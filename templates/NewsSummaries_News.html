Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised eyebrows after comparing President Trump’s border wall plans to the Berlin Wall separating communist Germany from the free world. The New York Democrat made her remarks during a livestream for supporters on Friday, where she spoke out about the scrutiny she received ever since she won the election last year and dethroned top Democrat Joe Crowley. “No matter how you feel about the wall, I think it’s a moral abomination,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the issue of the border wall that Trump has been pushing for since getting into office. “I think it’s like the Berlin Wall. I think it’s like any other wall designed to separate human beings and block out people who are running away from the humanitarian disasters.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deputy-ag-rod-rosenstein-expected-to-step-down-by-mid-march-official-says'>Timeline of Deputy AG Rosenstein's expected departure sharpens</a></h3><p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is expected to leave his role at the Justice Department by mid-March, a senior DOJ official told Fox News on Monday. An official announcement of who has been selected to replace Rosenstein could come as early as this week. A Trump administration official added that Attorney General William Barr has picked Jeffrey Rosen, who currently serves as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, to take over for Rosenstein. A graduate of Northwestern University and Harvard Law School, Rosen previously served as General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor for the White House Office of Management and Budget (2006 to 2009) and as General Counsel at the Department of Transportation (2003 to 2006), according to his online biography. Rosen, confirmed for his current role by the Senate in May 2017, works under Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in overseeing the daily operations of the department.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-apologizes-after-sharing-judges-photo-with-apperent-crosshair'>Roger Stone issues court apology after sharing judge's photo, denies threat</a></h3><p>“Please inform the Court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone on Monday was forced to apologize to the judge presiding over his criminal case after sharing a picture of her on social media. The photograph of Judge Amy Berman Jackson was posted on Instagram and included what some identified as a crosshair in the background, immediately prompting a backlash. He then deleted the post but later posted the same photograph again – just without the crosshair – and slammed his trial in a caption. “Through legal trickery Deep State hitman Robert Mueller has guaranteed that my upcoming show trial is before Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointed Judge who dismissed the Benghazi charges against Hillary Clinton and incarcerated Paul Manafort prior to his conviction for any crime,” Stone’s post was captioned.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/atf-joins-hunt-for-suspects-who-stole-79-guns-in-brazen-arkansas-hardware-store-burglary'>Cops release footage of suspects stealing 79 guns in store burglary</a></h3><p>Authorities in Arkansas released surveillance video Monday they say shows three suspects inside an Ace Hardware shop swiping 79 guns—mostly pistols—within two minutes after breaking into the store. The incident occurred at about 3 a.m. on Friday and the burglary did not trigger an alarm, The Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. The suspects, apparently emboldened, returned to the store in Prairie Grove about two hours later to steal a few more weapons, but set off the alarm during the reentry. They were in the store the second time and joined by a fourth person for four seconds. The suspects were not identified.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/people-love-to-talk-dolly-parton-denies-rumors-that-her-best-friend-is-her-secret-lover'>Dolly Parton speaks out on rumors about relationship with longtime friend</a></h3><p>Dolly Parton, in an exclusive interview published Monday, addressed long-standing rumors that her lifelong friend Judy Ogle is actually her secret lover despite being married to her husband for 53 years. The 73-year-old brushed off the “secret lover” rumors about Ogle, who she’s reportedly known since childhood and regularly calls her “girlfriend” (in a platonic way). Well, people love to talk, people love to gossip. They’ve said that about Oprah but it’s not true. “So people say that – because you can’t really have a great relationship with a woman.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/seaworld-san-diego-ride-gondolas-rescue-sdfd-506025701.html'>SeaWorld guests rescued after hours stranded on gondola ride</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/02/18/former-seahawks-safety-t-j-cunningham-shot-and-killed-in-parking-dispute/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Former NFL player shot and killed in a dispute over parking spot</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcsports.com/video/sharks-joe-thornton-scores-hat-trick-vs-bruins-first-2010?cid=eref:nbcnews:video'>Sharks star nets first hat trick since 2010</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2019/02/18/ap-poll-duke-reclaims-no-1-tennessee-falls-to-fifth/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Duke reclaims No. 1 spot in college basketball ranking</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/storm-forecast-bring-rain-snow-across-rockies-mid-atlantic-n972871'>Storm forecast to bring rain and snow across Rockies into Mid-Atlantic</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/four-people-found-dead-michigan-home-police-investigating-possible-murder-n972866'>3 children, 1 woman found dead in Michigan home</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/should-you-apply-refund-advance-your-tax-preparer-ncna972856'>Should you apply for a tax refund advance?</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/u-s-car-buyers-could-face-higher-prices-import-tariffs-n972831'>U.S. car buyers could face higher prices from import tariffs, auto industry warns</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/19/politics/primary-calendar-democrats-influence/index.html'>Analysis: The calendar is shifting Democratic influence in 2020 to voters of color</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/opinions/mccabe-25th-amendment-trump-shock-sracic/index.html'>Opinion: The real shock of Andrew McCabe's '60 Minutes' interview</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/politics/roger-stone-apologizes-instagram/index.html'>Roger Stone apologizes to judge for controversial Instagram post</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/19/roger-stone-instagram-post-michael-caputo-ac360-sot-vpx.cnn'>Ex-Trump aide on Stone: Hard to defend something stupid</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/18/angela-merkel-ivanka-trump-german-cars-security-threat-sot-sanger-nr-vpx.cnn'>Merkel hammers Trump as Ivanka looks on</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/politics/rod-rosenstein-mid-march/index.html'>Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein expected to leave Justice Department in mid-March </a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/europe/vatican-secret-rules-children-intl/index.html'>NYT: Vatican admits to secret rules for children of priests</a></h3></div></body>
