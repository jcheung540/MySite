Smollett, who had felony criminal charges approved against him Wednesday, turned himself in to police, authorities said. Smollett was charged just hours after he was "officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation" for allegedly "filing a false police report" in connection with his Jan. 29 attack claims, police said. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office approved the "Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report" charges. Smollett's attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson told Fox News Wednesday, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-fbi-general-counsel-thought-hillary-clinton-should-be-prosecuted-until-pretty-late-in-email-investigation'>Ex-FBI top lawyer thought Hillary should have been prosecuted for emails</a></h3><p>The FBI's top lawyer in 2016 thought Hillary Clinton and her team should have immediately realized they were mishandling "highly classified" information based on the obviously sensitive nature of the emails' contents sent through her private server. And he believed she should have been prosecuted until "pretty late" in the investigation, according to a transcript of his closed-door testimony before congressional committees last October. Former FBI general counsel James Baker said high-level officials at the bureau were "arguing about" whether to bring charges against Clinton, "I think, up until the end" -- and he initially thought Clinton's behavior was "alarming" and "appalling." 2 CABINET OFFICIALS READY TO SUPPORT 25TH AMENDMENT EFFORT: TESTIMONY Pursuant to the "statutes that we were considering at the time," Baker told lawmakers, it was "the nature and scope of the classified information that, to me, initially, when I looked at it, I thought these folks should know that this stuff is classified, that it was alarming what they were talking about, especially some of the most highly classified stuff.” Fox News has confirmed portions of the congressional transcript of Baker's remarks.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nike-working-to-identify-issue-after-duke-star-zion-williamson-sprains-knee-when-shoe-busts-open'>Duke phenom hurt in freak sneaker blowout, sending Nike into PR meltdown</a></h3><p>It’s got to be the shoes. Nike is “working to identify the issue” after Duke freshman Zion Williamson had his shoe burst apart mid-game Wednesday, forcing the star to leave the nationally broadcast event against rival North Carolina with a sprained knee as a packed house -- that included former President Barack Obama -- looked on. "We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery," Nike said in a statement obtained by ESPN. "The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.

Jason Mendez, 35, hit all eight members of the family following an argument he had with the father who had allegedly asked him not to blow cigarette smoke around his children, WCBS-TV reported. Mendez, of Washingtonville, got into his car and smashed into the Rockland County convenience store before he reversed the vehicle and plowed forward again, striking the family a second time, police said. A mangled baby carriage remained at the scene as witness told WNBC-TV they saw a woman lying on the ground injured and heard a baby crying.

The actions taken by the unidentified woman to ward off the intruder before responders could arrive at her residence on Feb. 12 were captured on her 911 call, ABC News reported Wednesday. The woman was reportedly heard on the audio of the call, obtained by the outlet from Jackson County Emergency Services officials, confirming that someone “tried to get in the back door.” In the midst of the alleged break-in, the woman shouted to the suspect, “I got something for you” before shooting a weapon, according to ABC News. She later reportedly fired off a second shot after the individual managed to get inside and up to another floor of her home.
