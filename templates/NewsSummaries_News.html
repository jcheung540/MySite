Top 2020 Dems say they back idea of reparations for black Americans: report</a></h3><p>Two leading Democratic presidential candidates -- U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- have reportedly said they support reparations for black Americans affected by slavery, reflecting a shift in the importance of race and identity issues within the party. The New York Times reported Thursday that Harris doubled down on her support for reparations after agreeing with a host on the popular radio show “The Breakfast Club” that the race-conscious policy was necessary to address the legacies of slavery and discrimination in the United States. "We have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities," Harris said in the statement to the Times. "I’m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/sports/charles-barkley-jokes-about-jussie-smollett-liam-neeson-controversies-during-tnts-nba-halftime-show'>Barkley's jokes about Smollett raise eyebrows during halftime show</a></h3><p>As America continues to process the Jussie Smollett controversy, outspoken former pro basketball star Charles Barkley raised eyebrows with his perspective Thursday night. During halftime of TNT’s coverage of the Houston Rockets-Los Angeles Lakers game, commentators Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson were considering a list of possible NBA scenarios as the league’s playoffs approach. At one point, they were asked which scenario had no chance of happening. “Two black guys beating a black guy up,” came Barkley’s reply, in an apparent reference to the Smollett case. The remark drew nervous laughter from his co-hosts and off-camera staffers.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/conservative-activist-tells-hannity-about-being-assaulted-on-uc-berkeley-campus'>DISTURBING FOOTAGE: Conservative recounts brutal attack at Cal-Berkeley</a></h3><p>A conservative activist whose brutal pummeling at Cal-Berkeley was caught on cell phone video told Sean Hannity Thursday he has no doubt that it was his political beliefs that prompted the attack. Hayden Williams said Tuesday's violent attack at the hands of an unidentified suspect on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley started when the assailant ironically accused him of promoting aggression. “This person claimed we were promoting violence on campus and proceeded to take his aggression out on us,” Williams told Hannity. Williams sported a black eye while appearing on the show, the result of being violently punched in the face while helping conservative group Turning Point USA recruit members. Although Williams was helping Turning Point USA he is not a member.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alex-trebek-suggests-who-should-replace-him-on-jeopardy'>Host stuns after nominating household name that should replace him</a></h3><p>While “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek has no plans to retire, he does have some ideas about who could replace him in the future. “It’s probably going to be a woman, somebody younger, somebody bright, somebody personable, somebody with a great sense of humor,” he said at the 92nd Street Y, joking, “So I nominated Betty White.” We’re told Trebek did offer some serious contenders like CNN’s Laura Coates, LA Kings announcer Alex Faust and TCM’s Ben Mankiewicz. Trebek also revealed, “I always wanted to be governor general of Canada ...

Nelson, who was inducted into to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012, was taking questions ahead of the Warriors’ game against the Sacramento Kings. The former coach was wearing a gold chain over his black shirt with his hair a bit longer than what it was when he was roaming the sidelines. The 78-year-old Michigan native was asked what he was doing since he left basketball and gave a very candid answer. “I've been smoking some pot,” Nelson said.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/atlanta-s-cyclorama-be-unveiled-again-amid-diverging-views-past-n974401'>Cyclorama to be unveiled again amid diverging views of past</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/how-much-karl-lagerfeld-s-195m-fortune-will-his-cat-n974416'>How much of Karl Lagerfeld's $195M fortune will his cat inherit?</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/kraft-heinz-shares-tank-20-percent-after-sec-probe-15-n974396'>Kraft Heinz shares tank 20 percent after SEC probe and $15 billion write-down</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-woman-who-joined-isis-sues-return-u-s-n974386'>Alabama woman who joined ISIS sues to return to the U.S.</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/france-s-bishops-agree-compensation-sex-abuse-victims-n974376'>Bishops offer 'financial gesture' to sex abuse victims in France</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/one-twin-was-u-s-citizen-other-wasn-t-until-n974366'>1 twin was U.S. citizen, other wasn't until judge's ruling</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/disgraced-enron-chief-jeffrey-skilling-released-federal-custody-n974361'>Disgraced Enron chief released from federal custody</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/look-why-brothers-alleged-jussie-smollett-hoax-appear-hook-n974346'>A look at why brothers in alleged Jussie Smollett hoax appear off the hook</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/politics/national-emergency-resolution-castro-donald-trump-mcconnell/index.html'>McConnell may face longest 18 days of his political life</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/22/politics/joe-biden-experience-record-2020/index.html'>Joe Biden's experience sets him apart.
