Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reportedly sounded the alarm in a closed-door meeting Thursday and said those Democrats were "putting themselves on a list." The legislation that prompted the infighting was a bill that would expand federal background checks for gun purchases, the Washington Post reported. But a key provision requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be notified if illegal immigrants attempt to purchase guns saw 26 moderate Democrats side with Republicans. According to the Post, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scolded her wayward center-leaning colleagues, telling them: "We are either a team or we’re not, and we have to make that decision.” But Ocasio-Cortez reportedly took it a step further.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-michael-cohen-demolishes-the-russia-collusion-conspiracy-will-anyone-be-fired-for-lies'>TUCKER CARLSON: How a lying turncoat accidentally killed Russia conspiracy</a></h3><p>Instead of confirming the Russia conspiracy that dominated and controlled American politics for more than two years, Michael Cohen just refuted it. What kind of witness is this guy anyway? This is getting very frustrating. Where do we get to the part where he blows the Russia case wide open and they lead Big Orange away in handcuffs and Hillary can be the president? Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump's high-profile lobbyer, toady, defender and personal attorney.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-campaign-spox-wont-be-able-to-vote-for-him-due-to-her-illegal-immigrant-status'>Guess why Bernie’s new spokeswoman can’t even vote for him in 2020</a></h3><p>Bernie Sanders’ newest deputy national press secretary won’t be able to cast a vote for her boss in the 2020 presidential election. That's because Belén Sisa, a millennial Arizona left-wing activist who joined the Democrat's staff this week, claims to be an illegal immigrant. “This is really emotional for me. I can’t help but think of 18-year-old Belén, who felt hopeless and powerless to the anti-immigrant attacks and policies that were holding her back from her dreams,” Sisa wrote on Facebook, recalling her younger self, as she announced her new job. “I can’t help but think of the generations of sacrifice my family has had to do for me to get here.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-man-executed-for-killing-estranged-wifes-family-nearly-30-years-ago'>Texas death-row inmate utters cryptic last words, then melee erupts</a></h3><p>A Texas death-row inmate who was executed Thursday for killing his estranged wife's family nearly 30 years ago, uttered cryptic final words before he died. "That'll be five dollars," Billie Wayne Coble, 70, of Waco, reportedly said. He told the five witnesses in attendance to "take care," according to reports. Although what Coble meant by the cyptic remark was unclear, it was likely a reference to his nickname, "$5 Bill," according to the Dallas Morning News. As Coble was finishing his statement, his son, a friend and a daughter-in-law became emotional and violent.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/mountain-lion-colorado-runner-killed-was-young-kitten-officials-say'>New twist on story about runner who killed mountain lion with bare hands</a></h3><p>The mountain lion a Colorado runner claimed to have killed in January was a young kitten, according to wildlife officials. Travis Kauffman, 31, strangled and bludgeoned the cat to death on Feb. 4 at Horsetooth Mountain Open Space in Larimer County, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a necropsy report published by Fox affiliate KDVR. The mountain lion was determined to be around 3 to 4 months old and weighed 24 pounds at the time of its necropsy. The animal was scavenged after its death. Kauffman told reporters earlier this month that he engaged in what was "just like a wrestling match" with the lion, after it attacked him while he was running alone.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-s-corruption-cases-what-happens-n978036'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption cases — What happens next?</a></h3><p>The attorney-general said he intends to charge Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust in that case. No. JERUSALEM — Benjamin Netanyahu is the dominant Israeli politician of his generation. No rival comes close in political skill to the Likud Party leader known widely as "Bibi". But on Thursday, Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said he intends to indict Netanyahu in three corruption cases on charges of bribery and fraud and breach of trust, pending a pre-trial hearing.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/7-1-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-peru-n978026'>7.1-magnitude earthquake hits southern Peru</a></h3><p>LIMA, Peru — The U.S. Geological Survey is reporting that an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.1 has struck southern Peru.

Troopers found 60-year-old Robert Brandel of North Tonawanda tied up in his pickup truck Monday in a parking lot in Newfane, 30 miles north of Buffalo. Brandel told troopers two men involved in his Super Bowl squares robbed him of $16,000, drove him around for two days and left him tied up in his pickup. Investigators determined Brandel had entered some fake names in his $50,000 squares pool hoping to take most of the winnings, but instead ended up short for the payouts. Brandel was charged with fraud and falsely reporting an incident.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/environmental-disaster-unfolding-pacific-grounded-ship-leaks-tons-oil-near-n978011'>Environmental disaster unfolds in Pacific as grounded ship leaks tons of oil</a></h3><p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — An environmental disaster is unfolding in the Pacific after a large ship ran aground and began leaking oil next to a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Solomon Islands, Australian officials said Friday. Footage taken this week shows little progress has been made in stopping the Solomon Trader ship from leaking oil since it ran aground Feb. 5, according to the Australian High Commission in the Solomon Islands. Australian experts estimate more than 80 tons of oil has leaked into the sea and shoreline in the ecologically delicate area and that more than 660 tons of oil remains aboard the Hong Kong-flagged ship, which is continuing to leak. The ship was chartered by the Bintan Mining company in the Solomon Islands to carry bauxite, which is used in aluminum production. Bintan Solomon Islands chief executive Fred Tang was not immediately available for comment Friday.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/moments-execution-texas-killer-tells-witnesses-ll-be-5-n978006'>Moments before execution, Texas killer tells witnesses, 'That'll be $5'</a></h3><p>HUNTSVILLE, Texas — A Texas inmate was executed Thursday evening for the killings nearly 30 years ago of his estranged wife's parents and her brother, who was a police officer. Billie Wayne Coble received lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the August 1989 shooting deaths of Robert and Zelda Vicha and their son, Bobby Vicha, at separate homes in Axtell, northeast of Waco. Coble, 70, once described by a prosecutor as having "a heart full of scorpions," was the oldest inmate executed by Texas since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. Asked to make a final statement, Coble replied: "That'll be $5." He told the five witnesses he selected to be in attendance that he loved them, then again said: "That'll be $5."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-won-t-sign-stripping-mongols-motorcycle-club-its-trademark-n977906'>Judge refuses to strip Mongols motorcycle club of its trademark</a></h3><p>A federal judge in California has declined to approve a jury’s decision to strip the Mongols motorcycle club of its trademarked logo. U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who oversaw the racketeering trial late last year when the Mongol Nation was convicted, cited constitutional protections against intrusions on free speech and excessive fines, in his decision Thursday. "The First Amendment and Eighth Amendment permanently prohibit the Government's request to forfeit the rights associated with the collective symbols," Carter wrote in the decision. Prosecutors said they were disappointed in the ruling and are considering an appeal. Attorney Joe Yanny, who represents the Mongols, said that the ruling will protect members of all groups.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fda-warns-against-using-surgical-robots-breast-cancer-surgery-n977931'>FDA warns against using surgical robots for breast cancer surgery</a></h3><p>The FDA warned patients and health care providers Thursday about using robotically assisted surgical devices for mastectomies and other cancer surgeries because of "preliminary" evidence that it may be linked to lower long-term survival. The FDA's official safety communication said that while robotic "surgery may help reduce pain, blood loss, scarring, infection, and recovery time," there is "limited, preliminary evidence" that using the devices for cancers that affect women, specifically breast and cervical cancer, may be associated with diminished long-term survival. In a statement, Dr. Terri Cornelison, assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the FDA is "warning patients and providers that the use of robotically assisted surgical devices for any cancer-related surgery has not been granted marketing authorization by the agency, and therefore the survival benefits to patients when compared to traditional surgery have not been established." She also said the FDA was aware that "surgeons have been using the device for uses not granted marketing authorization by the FDA."</p><br><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/nyt-trump-kelly-kushner-clearance/index.html'>NYT: Trump demanded Kushner get top-secret security clearance</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/phil-mudd-trump-lets-go-kushner-clearance-sot-tsr-vpx.cnn'>Phil Mudd to Trump: Let's go!</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/james-clapper-intv-jared-kushner-trump-security-clearance-sot-tsr-vpx.cnn'>Clapper: Trump's order is dangerous</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/us/cohen-trump-hearing-race-analysis-blake/index.html'>Analysis: The problem with the 'black best friend' excuse</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/lynne-patton-racism-meadows-lynne-patton-prop-tokenism-ctn-vpx.cnn'>Panelist rips Meadows for 'asinine' remarks: Infuriating to watch</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/joe-biden-mike-pence-decent-guy-criticize-respond/index.html'>Joe Biden responds to criticism after calling Pence a 'decent guy'</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/joe-biden-nebraska-speech-trump-joke-sot-vpx.ketv'>Crowd cracks up over Biden's Trump joke</a></h3></div></body>
