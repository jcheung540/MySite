Pelosi even reportedly walked out of a meeting Wednesday with Democrat House members, setting down her microphone and telling attendees, “Well if you're not going to listen to me, I’m done talking." The stalled resolution originated after freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, for at least the second time in recent months, ignited an uproar for echoing tropes critics have deemed anti-Semitic. In February, she suggested on Twitter that supporters of Israel have been bought.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andrew-c-mccarthy-would-mueller-indict-trump-for-attempting-to-fire-mueller'>Fox News: ANDREW McCARTHY: One big problem with Mueller's shift to obstruction</a></h3><p>With indications that special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report is imminent, talk of “no collusion” is dominating chatter by the president, his fans, and his critics. That is, a finding of no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia is widely anticipated. Yet, my sense is that, more than on collusion, Mueller may focus on the obstruction aspect of his investigation. I want to examine an element of that, involving the status of Mueller himself. New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Michael S. Schmidt have highlighted Trump’s purported “attempts” to fire Mueller, which mainly involved “trying to get” then-White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire him.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-city-agrees-to-pay-27-million-to-lease-parking-lot-it-sold-for-1'>Fox News: City to pay through the nose to lease lot it sold for $1: report</a></h3><p>“We’re paying them for something that we gave them. The city of Newark, N.J. has agreed to pay $27 million over 30 years to rent property that it previously sold in 2017 for just $1, leading some to question why the city didn't just hold on to the land in the first place. This is basic math, it doesn’t add up,” Newark resident Debra Salters told NJ.com Wednesday during a City Council meeting, where the deal was narrowly approved in a 5-4 vote. This is basic math, it doesn’t add up.” The autonomous Newark Parking Authority plans to erect offices, retail space and a five-story parking deck with 515 spaces at 43-67 Green Street under a $34 million redevelopment agreement with the city, the news site reported. Newark will rent storage space for its municipal court, relocate its finance department to the property and will rent 258 working spaces for use during working hours, the report said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-warrants-reveal-chilling-details-in-case-of-patrick-frazee-report'>Fox News: Cops look into bizarre post hours after woman's brutal murder: reports</a></h3><p>A woman who shares the name of a suspected killer’s mother, reportedly wrote “YAY the witch is dead,” on her Facebook wall a few hours after the man killed his fiancée, according to a police warrant. The detail was revealed Wednesday morning after Colorado state officials released more than 20 warrants related to the ongoing investigation of Patrick Frazee, a man whom authorities believe murdered his fiancée, Kelsey Berreth. Search warrants executed by multiple agencies on Frazee’s home have uncovered significant potential evidence, including a baseball bat, five teeth and a bed sheet with possible blood, among other items, a newspaper reported. Frazee is believed to have killed Berreth with a baseball bat in her Woodland Park apartment on the afternoon of Nov. 22 – the day she was last seen alive – according to an arrest affidavit cited by Denver's KMGH-TV. She was last seen on surveillance footage with her daughter at a Safeway supermarket around 12:30 p.m. that day.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/science/4-canadian-wolves-captured-air-dropped-in-us-national-park-to-help-restore-population'>Fox News: Wolves airdropped into US park to hunt, control moose population</a></h3><p>Four Canadian wolves were captured and air-dropped on Lake Superior's Isle Royale National Park in Michigan—effectively doubling the pack’s current numbers—as part of an effort to rebuild the dwindling wolf population and help control the moose population, officials said Monday. Helicopter crews fired net guns to capture the wolves, three males and one female, in Ontario last week, the National Park Service said. The wolves were sedated and examined by veterinarians before being transported to the U.S. "I am ... blown away by the resilience of these wolves, who within hours after undergoing capture and handling and arriving on Isle Royale, immediately got on the trail of their pack mates," said Mark Romanski, the park's natural resources division chief. An Ontario wolf was captured with a net at Michipicoten Island in Ontario, Canada.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-city-will-have-last-blockbuster-store-world-n980401'>Oregon city will have last Blockbuster store in world</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-house-panel-approves-anti-abortion-heartbeat-bill-n980386'>Georgia House panel approves anti-abortion 'heartbeat' bill</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teacher-wins-10-000-contest-buried-insurance-policy-s-small-n980371'>She read insurance policy's small print — and walked away with $10,000</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/thai-court-disbands-political-party-nominating-princess-n980376'>Thai court disbands political party for nominating princess</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Taco-Bell-Workers-Couple-Attack-Fight-Video-Philadelphia-Center-City-506743201.html'>Taco Bell workers fired after leaping over counter and beating customers</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Jason-Momoa-Plane-Makes-Emergency-Landing-506799051.html'>'Aquaman' star's plane makes emergency landing</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/thief-steals-600-seattle-girl-scout-cookie-stand-n980341'>Thief makes off with $600 from Girl Scout cookie stand</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/rep-sylvia-garcia-honored-edward-roybal-award-public-service-n980271'>Texas congresswoman Sylvia García honored with public service award</a></h3><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/2020-democrats-rankings/index.html'>Analysis: It's now or never for Democrats who want to be president</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/politics/ivanka-trump-security-clearance-white-house/index.html'>What Ivanka Trump does </a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/politics/abizaid-us-saudi-gangster/index.html'>Saudi prince has gone 'full gangster,' says GOP Senator Rubio</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/ilhan-omar-house-democrats-anti-semitism-diversion/index.html'>Analysis: How a public feud over anti-Semitism dealt House Dems at real setback </a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/house-democrats-impeachment-investigations/index.html'>Most Democrats call for investigation instead of impeachment</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/politics/donald-trump-polling-numbers-economy/index.html'>Analysis: Here's the best poll number for Donald Trump this year</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/07/anderson-cooper-kirstjen-nielsen-border-separations-kth-ac360-vpx.cnn'>Cooper stunned by Trump official's 'Orwellian' response</a></h3></div></body>
