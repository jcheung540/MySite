Gov. Justin Fairfax has retained the same law firm that represented now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was going through the confirmation process and faced decades-old sexual misconduct allegations, Fox News has learned. The woman accusing Fairfax of rape, Dr. Vanessa C. Tyson, meanwhile, has hired the attorneys who represented Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser, who alleged that he'd thrown her onto a bed and muffled her screams at a high school party. Fairfax hired the boutique trial firm Wilkinson Walsh Eskovitz last year, when Tyson first took her allegations to The Washington Post. The Post, which first published Ford's bombshell claims just days before Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation was set for a crucial Senate vote, said it declined to publish Tyson's account at the time because it "could not find anyone who could corroborate" her statements.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-steve-scalise-says-house-dems-refused-to-let-him-testify-at-gun-violence-hearing'>Rep. Steve Scalise says Dems refused to let him testify at gun violence hearing</a></h3><p>House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Wednesday that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee refused to let him testify at a hearing on gun violence about his experience as a victim of the congressional baseball practice shooting two years ago. The move infuriated his fellow Republicans. Scalise told Fox News that he found out over the weekend that Democrats had chosen not to allow his testimony at the hearing --“Preventing Gun Violence: A Call to Action” -- something he said is a courtesy traditionally extended to any lawmaker who wishes to speak. “I thought it outrageous that they want to try to silence this message, because in the end I’m still going to get my message out. They can’t silence this issue,” he said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-president-trumps-state-of-the-union-changed-history'>NEWT GINGRICH: Trump SOTU changed history – Here's what Pelosi must've felt</a></h3><p>Every once in a while a speech is so effective and powerful it changes the trajectory of history. President Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address was that kind of speech. If you have not seen it, you should watch it online. Reading it will only convey 10 percent of its power. It was the interaction of the president with the members of Congress and the audience in the galleries that was so compelling.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/photo-of-joy-behar-dressed-as-beautiful-african-woman'>Photo of Joy Behar dressed as 'beautiful African woman' resurfaces</a></h3><p>A long forgotten video clip from ABC's "The View" resurfaced on Wednesday that showed co-host Joy Behar trying to explain a Halloween costume from when she was younger. The clip was shared by The Wrap media editor Jon Levine. Behar was seen discussing a New York Times op-ed about the resurgence of curly hair during the show in 2016. Behar showed her colleagues and the audience a picture of herself with curly hair when she was 29 years old. The co-hosts appeared surprised by her drastically different look.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/todd-starnes-i-had-a-front-row-seat-at-trumps-state-of-the-union-you-wont-believe-what-i-saw'>TODD STARNES: I went to the State of the Union – You won't believe what I saw</a></h3><p>I was honored to be among those Americans selected to sit in the House gallery at the State of the Union address Tuesday night. I was a guest of Rep. Jody Hice, a Republican congressman from Georgia. It was one of those uniquely American moments – where strangers sat together – many of opposing political views – united under the belief that we are a free people, one nation – under God. My seatmate was a Democrat from Illinois. She runs a non-profit food pantry in Aurora.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/two-men-arrested-trying-smuggle-drugs-gay-cruise-ship-police-n968591'>Two men arrested on drug charges while boarding Atlantis gay cruise</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-4-people-killed-when-plane-crashed-calif-house-are-n968646'>Family of the 4 people killed by plane crash into house are 'devastated' by loss</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gas-explosion-san-francisco-shoots-fire-burns-multiple-buildings-n968636'>Gas explosion shoots fire that burns multiple buildings</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/florida-woman-gets-life-sentence-husband-s-death-was-initially-n968631'>Florida woman gets life sentence in husband's death that was initially blamed on alligators</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/photographer-who-allegedly-preyed-underage-models-called-serial-sexual-predator-n968571'>Photographer who allegedly assaulted underage models called 'serial predator'</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cbs-names-new-chief-60-minutes-n968611'>CBS names a new chief for '60 Minutes'</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/mandy-moore-says-us-gives-us-chance-process-our-feelings-ncna967271'>Mandy Moore says 'This is Us' gives us a chance to process our feelings</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-who-stopped-help-driver-450-foot-high-california-bridge-n968536'>Man who stopped to help driver on a California bridge falls to his death</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='/2019/02/06/health/climate-change-congress/index.html'>On Capitol Hill, new calls for rapid action on climate change</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='/videos/politics/2019/02/06/hirono-trump-congress-threatening-people-dealmaking-sot-tsr-vpx.cnn'>Senator: Trump is threatening Congress</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='/2019/02/06/politics/fairfax-kavanaugh-lawyers/index.html'>Virginia lt. governor retains Kavanaugh's lawyers.
