Omar to 9/11 goes on display at West Virginia capitol, sparking outrage</a></h3><p>A poster displayed at the West Virginia statehouse Friday linking Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, has sparked outrage among lawmakers. The poster, which was displayed on a table in the rotunda in the Capitol, showed a split picture of the World Trade Center on fire on top of a snap of Omar. “’Never Forget’ – You said..” the caption on the picture of the twin towers read. Meanwhile, the caption of the picture of Omar read, “I am the proof you have forgotten.” The poster was part of the display for “WV GOP Day,” which is when the “Republicans Take the Rotunda,” NBC News reported. Omar became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in November.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/billboard-mocking-cnn-appears-outside-of-networks-hollywood-headquarters'>SEE THE MESSAGE: Mocking billboard appears at CNN's Hollywood office</a></h3><p>A group of conservative street artists hijacked a billboard in Hollywood on Friday morning and took aim at CNN, which so happened to be across the street. Known as The Faction, their latest project slammed CNN and its president Jeff Zucker for its coverage of this week’s summit in Hanoi, Vietnam between President Donald Trump and North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. The billboard, which referred to CNN as “Communist News Network,” dawned the phrase “Keep Korea divided” with an asterisk that read “because OrangeManBad.” It also featured an image of Jeff Zucker, whose title was “CEO, CNNPC,” a reference to the “non-playable character” meme which has depicted liberals as robotic. “When Trump speaks glowingly of Kim Jong Un it's a tactic,” an anonymous member of The Faction told The Hollywood Reporter.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-charged-with-murdering-wife-after-impaling-her-on-corn-rake-after-learning-about-secret-affairs'>Man accused of killing wife with corn rake after learning about secret affairs</a></h3><p>An Iowa man has been accused of fatally stabbing his wife with a corn rake after learning she had a couple of secret affairs, with the victim leaving notes warning that he might kill her. Amy Mullis, 39, has been found dead on Nov. 10 at her farm about four miles northwest of Earlville. Authorities initially said that the woman has been fatally injured in a fall, with her husband Todd Mullis telling 911 that no one had seen what happened. But the initial suspicion of an accident has been ruled out in December after an autopsy showed that the woman had six puncture wounds and listed the manner of her death as homicide. Police now formally charged Mullis with the murder of his wife.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/elderly-tennessee-woman-mauled-to-death-by-six-german-shepherds-in-vicious-attack'>Woman, 88, mauled to death by pack of German shepherds</a></h3><p>An 88-year-old Tennessee woman has been mauled to death by six German shepherds, with the authorities considering criminal charges against the dogs’ owner. Jill Peterson was viciously attacked by the dogs on Tuesday night behind her own home while clearing a drainage ditch. “They dragged her down the yard and all of her clothes were off, her shoes, everything. They tore all of her hair out, the casket can’t be open, it’s like a nightmare. It’s hard to believe,” sister Nina Brown told News Channel 5.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/science/massive-700-pound-alligator-in-georgia-discovered-in-irrigation-ditch'>Enormous, 700-pound gator found in Georgia irrigation ditch</a></h3><p>A roughly 13-foot, 700-pound alligator was found in an irrigation ditch, officials with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources said this week. The massive reptile was found in the ditch near Lake Blackshear, Melissa Cummings, a spokeswoman for the Georgia DNR, told First Coast News. “It’s a testament to Georgia’s alligator-management program that alligators can grow to this size,” she said. “The only way these animals get this large is by avoiding humans.” The animal’s size apparently led many who saw its picture on social media to think the image was a “hoax.” But Brent Howze, the wildlife biologist who is seen crouching behind the reptile in the photo, said it was not. “Apparently a lot of people think it’s fake, but I can assure you that it is not,” he told the Cordele Dispatch.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/8-killed-india-pakistan-fighting-amid-high-tensions-n978531'>8 killed in India-Pakistan fighting amid high tensions</a></h3><p>SRINAGAR, India — Indian and Pakistani soldiers have again targeted each other's posts and villages along their volatile frontier in disputed Kashmir, killing at least six civilians and two Pakistani troops, officials said Saturday. Tensions have run high since Indian aircraft crossed into Pakistan this past Tuesday, carrying out what India called a preemptive strike against militants blamed for a Feb. 14 suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops. Pakistan retaliated, shooting down a fighter jet Wednesday and detaining its pilot, who was returned to India on Friday in a peace gesture. Fighting resumed overnight Friday. Pakistan's military said two of its soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire with Indian forces near the Line of Control that separates Kashmir between the rivals.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2019/03/02/tottenham-peg-arsenal-back-on-derby-day-video/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Fierce rivals Spurs, Arsenal tie in dramatic Premier League clash</a></h3><p>LONDON — Controversy reigned as Tottenham Hotspur drew 1-1 with Arsenal in the north London derby at Wembley on Saturday. Harry Kane’s penalty kick (which should not have been awarded as he was offside) nicked a point for Spurs after Aaron Ramsey had given a solid Gunners side the lead in the first half. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then had a 90th minute penalty kick saved by Hugo Lloris as Arsenal missed the perfect chance to close the gap to their bitter rivals with Lucas Torreira sent off in stoppage time for the Gunners. With the draw, their first of the season, Spurs remain in third on 61 points. Arsenal stay in fourth and have 57 points.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-knows-what-you-it-can-send-you-samples-boost-n978386'>Amazon knows what you like — and it can send you samples to boost buying</a></h3><p>Brandon Mullins wasn’t expecting an Amazon order this week, but when he opened the parcel delivered to his home in New York City, he found a protein bar sample and a note from the e-commerce giant. It wasn’t a fluke. Mullins has a protein powder subscription on Amazon, so he was exactly the type of customer that nutrition company BSN wanted to target with a sample of its Protein Crisp bars. His box was one of 100,000 sent out in the past week, according to Kris Gerulski, marketing director at BSN North America.

Omar blasted again for what critics call anti-Semitism</a></h3><p>ST. PAUL, Minn. — Rep. Ilhan Omar came under a fresh round of criticism Friday for remarks about Israel that critics decried as anti-Semitic. Speaking Wednesday night at a forum at a Washington, D.C., bookstore with fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the Minnesota Democrat said she fears everything they say about Israel is construed as anti-Semitic because they're Muslim. She said that prevents a "broader debate" about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Omar and Tlaib won their seats in November, becoming the first Muslim women elected to Congress. The comments, which Omar made when the questions turned to her previous criticism of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, were first reported by the website Jewish Insider.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/jordin-sparks-upcoming-tv-series-based-black-woman-s-story-n975741'>Jordin Sparks' upcoming TV series is based on this black woman's remarkable story</a></h3><p>Television producer and writer Ranada Shepard’s story is finding its way onto the small screen in the new Kenya Barris (“Black-ish,” “Grown-ish”) comedy set to air on ABC’s Freeform. Shepard is the creator of “Born Again Virgin,” which premiered on TV One in 2015. Last year, she was hoping to land a writing job on ABC’s “Black-ish.” However, not landing that gig led her down a different path. “They said you didn’t get the job,” she told NBCBLK in a recent phone interview. “But Kenya is interested in you for a straight-to-series [show] about the quarter-life crisis, a companion piece to ‘Grown-ish.’” The new show, which is currently untitled, stars actress and singer Jordin Sparks, and starts filming in March.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-heads-home-vietnam-after-n978506'>North Korea's Kim heads home after Trump nuclear summit collapse</a></h3><p>DONG DANG, Vietnam — Smiling and holding up his clasped hands in a victorious pose, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday boarded his private train at the Vietnam-China border for a 60-plus-hour ride home, ending a trip to Vietnam that saw a summit breakdown with President Donald Trump. He spent his last day in Hanoi laying large red-and-yellow wreaths at a war memorial and at the mausoleum of national hero Ho Chi Minh, surrounded by Vietnamese soldiers in crisp white uniforms and his own entourage of top North Korean officials. At the border, he got out of his armored limousine and clasped his hands, waving to a crowd of people cheering his departure. Since Trump flew home to Washington, Kim has stepped assuredly into the spotlight, keen to show himself as a poised leader taking his rightful place on the international stage.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/isis-brink-defeat-syria-u-s-backed-forces-launch-final-n978501'>ISIS on the brink of defeat in Syria as U.S.-backed forces launch final attack</a></h3><p>DEIR AL-ZOR PROVINCE, Syria — The Islamic State faced final territorial defeat on Saturday as the U.S.-backed Syrian force battling the jihadists said it was closing in on their last bastion near the Iraqi border, capping years-long efforts to roll back the group. "We expect it to be over soon," Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told Reuters. While the fall of Baghouz, an eastern Syrian village on the bank of the Euphrates River, would mark a milestone in the campaign against the jihadists, they remain a threat, using guerrilla tactics and holding some desolate land further west. An array of enemies, both local and international, confronted ISIS after it declared a modern-day "caliphate" in 2014 across large swathes of territory it had seized in Syria and neighboring Iraq.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/striking-oakland-teachers-reach-deal-end-walkout-includes-11-percent-n978476'>Striking Oakland teachers reach deal to end walkout, includes 11 percent pay raise</a></h3><p>OAKLAND, Calif. — Striking teachers in Oakland, California, reached a contract agreement Friday with district officials to end a week-long walkout. The Oakland Education Association, which represents the city's 3,000 teachers, said union leaders reached a four-year agreement that calls for an 11 percent salary increase and a one-time 3 percent bonus. The deal also requires the district to reduce class sizes and hire more student support staff, including special education teachers and counselors, the union said in a statement. The deal, reached on the strike's 7th day, still needs to be voted on by teachers. Teachers were expected to vote Saturday, and if the deal is approved, return to classrooms next week.</p><br><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/ilhan-omar-engel-statement/index.html'>Engel tells Omar to apologize for saying pro-Israel groups push foreign allegiance</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/02/stephanie-grisham-melania-trump-communications-director-be-best-paul-nr-vpx.cnn'>Melania's spokeswoman questioned over Trump's behavior</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.comhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/2020-campaign-selma-alabama-march/h_1be38818a5e430dec9a5bbbb205ce742'>Live updates  O'Rourke might announce his 2020 plans soon</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/02/kim-jong-un-otto-warmbier-donald-trump-anderson-cooper-kth-sot-ac360-vpx.cnn'>Anderson Cooper: Just think about this for a moment ...</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.comhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-cpac-2019/index.html'>Live updates  Trump speaks at CPAC</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/02/cuomo-matt-schlapp-cpac-trump-lies-cpt-vpx.cnn'>Chris Cuomo clashes with CPAC chairman over Trump's lies</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/jared-kushner-donald-trump-security-clearance/index.html'>Analysis: Kushner clearance story reveals Trump's biggest flaws</a></h3></div></body>
