Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who announced a sweeping "Green New Deal" on Thursday that promises to render air travel obsolete, get rid of flatulent cows and ensure economic security for everyone in less than a decade, seemingly contradicted herself in a span of twelve hours on the nature of the government's role in the massive undertaking. NPR host Steve Inskeep asked Ocasio-Cortez Thursday morning about concerns from conservatives that the 29-year-old former bartender's proposal involves an unconstitutional government overreach, as well as the unsustainable and dangerous elimination of huge swaths of the American economy. "One reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don’t like," Inskeep asked. "Are you prepared to put on that table that, 'Yes actually they’re right, what this requires is massive government intervention?'"</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wsj-writer-slams-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-says-it-looks-like-dem-parody-bill-written-by-gop'>WSJ writer slams 'Green' deal, says it looked like GOP penned as a joke</a></h3><p>The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel issued a blistering critique of the proposed Green New Deal, saying that the proposal reads like a parody of the Democratic Party done by Republicans. “By the end of the Green New Deal resolution (and accompanying fact sheet) I was laughing so hard I nearly cried,” Strassel wrote on Twitter. “If a bunch of GOPers plotted to forge a fake Democratic bill showing how bonkers the party is, they could not have done a better job. It is beautiful.” The Green New Deal, pushed by freshman New York Democrat Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, attempts to radically transform the country, including rendering air travel obsolete, move the U.S. to rely completely on renewable energy with net-zero emissions, and guarantee economic security even for people who are “unwilling” to work. But the sweeping proposal was hit with mockery once the details were unveiled on Thursday, with many pointing out how unrealistic the suggestions are.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roberts-joins-supreme-courts-liberal-wing-in-striking-down-louisiana-abortion-law'>Chief Justice joins High Court liberals to block La. anti-abortion law</a></h3><p>Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Supreme Court's liberal wing on Thursday in temporarily blocking a Louisiana law that would have placed restrictions on abortion clinics, in the high court's first major ruling on abortion since the confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The ruling comes as Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has increasingly and deliberately sought to present the federal judiciary as nonpartisan, amid a flurry of attacks from progressive groups arguing that the Supreme Court's new conservative majority imperils the country. Last year, in a highly unusual statement, Roberts rebuked President Trump for criticizing partisanship in the federal judiciary. The Louisiana law is virtually identical to a Texas measure the justices struck down three years ago by a 5-3 vote, shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-wearing-blackface-is-fairly-common-on-the-elite-left-modern-liberalism-is-all-about-hypocrisy'>TUCKER CARLSON: Blackface as common as hypocrisy on the far left</a></h3><p>It's pretty clear that the very people most likely to wear blackface are also the most likely to demand that you get fired if you do the same. That's the definition of hypocrisy. But, it's deeper than that. Hypocrisy isn't simply a recurring feature of modern liberalism. It's the whole point of it.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/groom-sexually-assaulted-waitress-at-wedding-reception-fought-with-police-cops'>Groom allegedly sexually assaulted underage waitress at wedding reception</a></h3><p>A New Jersey groom is facing a slew of charges related to his wedding reception where he allegedly groped a waitress and got into a brawl with police. According to court documents, the groom, Matthew Aimers, approached an underage waitress at his November 2018 wedding reception at the Northampton Valley Country Club in Northampton Township, Pa. He allegedly "asked her to go outside and make out." After she spurned his advances, he allegedly followed her into a bathroom and sexually assaulted her and exposed himself. At one point, he propositioned her with $100 before she was able to break free and leave, according to prosecutors.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/kellyanne-conway-says-she-was-assaulted-last-year-maryland-restaurant-n969231'>Kellyanne Conway says she was assaulted last year at Maryland restaurant</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/finland-s-basic-income-experiment-hits-halfway-mark-n969211'>Finland gave $636 a month to unemployed people.
