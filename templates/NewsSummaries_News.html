Lee, a lifelong New York Knicks basketball fan, compared the "Green Book" win to a referee making "the wrong call." In a stunning move shortly after "Green Book" was announced the winner, the director walked toward the back of the auditorium, according to a reporter for Deadline. He eventually got back to his seat and got into what appeared to be an intense conversation with the writer Jordan Peele. The report said that Lee turned his back to the stage during the speech.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-says-she-moved-to-new-bronx-apartment'>Ocasio-Cortez confirms move after neighbors raise residency doubts</a></h3><p>Freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday night confirmed The Post’s reporting that she’s relocated to a new Bronx apartment in her neighborhood. A day after residents at the Democratic congresswoman’s listed address told The Post they’d never seen her around, her spokesman on Sunday said she moved recently to a larger apartment “a block and a half away” with her boyfriend. In a tweet, the left-wing darling also said she remained a Bronx resident. “I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez, 29, wrote in response to The Post’s reporting. On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez ducked questions about her living situation after an appearance.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kendall-jenner-wears-jaw-dropping-dress-to-oscars'>Top model turns heads in barely there dress at Oscar after-party</a></h3><p>Kendall Jenner left little to the imagination while wearing a jaw-dropping dress to an after party following the 91st Academy Awards on Sunday night. The sleeveless black gown featured two panels hanging down from the front and back, showing her legs from the hips.

There will be the usual lamentations about Hollywood self-indulgence and hypocrisy, the annual complaints about the movies that went unrewarded in favor of films like last year's “Moonlight” which nobody saw, the absolute astonishment that the sum total of our wildly creative industries produced, most likely, another dud of an evening. All those things are fair, and true, but that is not why Hollywood deserves our scorn. The real charge against our Leftcoast elites is that they bear a pressing responsibility today, which they utterly ignore. Our country is indeed divided, and becoming more so.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/oscars-2019-bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-perform-shallow-from-a-star-is-born'>WATCH: Gaga, Cooper sing Oscars duet, set social media ablaze</a></h3><p>Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper got quite close while performing "Shallow" from "A Star Is Born" at the 2019 Oscars on Sunday. Seated in the front row of Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre, Cooper, 44, and Gaga, 32, entered the stage with no fanfare and no outfit changes, wearing the same tux and black gown that they'd sported on the red carpet. At the end of Cooper's first verse, Gaga sat across from him at the piano, never breaking her intense eye contact with her co-star and director. W Magazine wrote, "Cooper and Gaga's connection was so strong, at the end of their performance their mouths were a couple of breaths away from a kiss." The pair received a standing ovation from the crowd and hugged before exiting the stage.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/president-trump-tweets-spike-lee-racist-against-him-n975586'>President Trump tweets that Spike Lee is 'racist' against him</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-verify-north-korea-s-nuclear-weapons-heart-trump-kim-n975576'>Kim doesn't want to give Trump a list of nuke sites.
