Bob Menendez, D-N.J., had a fiery exchange with a reporter on Capitol Hill on Wednesday when asked to comment on the Green New Deal. Henry Rodgers, the Daily Caller's Capitol Hill reporter, approached the senator at a subway station and asked him if he supported Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's legislative proposal. Menendez avoided the question and asked where Rodgers worked. Rodgers said that when he told Menendez he worked for the Daily Caller, the Democrat responded by saying he would not answer any questions. An intern who was with Rodgers asked a follow-up question, and tensions apparently rose.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-bongino-americans-still-love-capitalism-here-are-three-reasons-why-they-arent-flocking-to-socialism'>DAN BONGINO: Three reasons why we aren’t embracing AOC’s socialism</a></h3><p>In a world where we now have three so-called "democratic" socialists in office (which is an oxymoron if I've ever seen one), you'd think the American public must be increasingly moving to the left. But you would be wrong. A brand-new Fox News poll disputes that thesis. The poll, which was released on February 13 finds that “Fifty-seven percent of voters have a positive opinion of capitalism. That’s more than twice the number who feel the same about socialism (25 percent).” How about that.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-pounce-after-rep-gwen-moore-follows-list-of-economic-wins-with-blah-blah-blah'>Dem congresswoman mocks Trump's economic achievements, faces backlash</a></h3><p>A House Democrat's "blah blah blah" mockery of key Trump administration accomplishments drew a quick response on Twitter on Wednesday from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., appeared unimpressed as she read a list of the economic successes of the Trump administration during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. "GDP is great, unemployment is at an all-time low, African-Americans are doing well, Hispanics are doing well, wages are rising at the fastest pace in ten years -- blah, blah, blah,” Moore, a congresswoman since 2005, said at the hearing. Afterward, McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted a video of Moore making the remarks, adding an overlay of the words "blah blah blah" for emphasis. "From the party that claims to be #ForThePeople," McCarthy wrote.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-store-that-quit-selling-nike-products-over-kaepernick-ad-goes-out-of-business'>Colorado store goes out of business for Kaepernick stand, owner defiant</a></h3><p>The owner of a sporting goods store in Colorado says his shop is going out of business after he stopped selling Nike products over the company's controversial campaign with Colin Kaepernick. Prime Time Sports, in Colorado Springs, is shuttering its doors after "21 mostly good years," owner Stephen Martin wrote on Facebook Monday. He advertised 40 percent off all merchandise, and thanked those who "offered help and support through the 'Honor The Flag' memorial wall and NIKE boycott." Martin said he can't afford to stay open anymore after he stopped selling Nike products, in protest after the sports brand featured Kaepernick, a former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, in its "Just Do It" campaign. The controversial ad from the campaign included a photo of Kaepernick's face, with the words "Believe in something.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/health/president-trump-caused-post-trump-sex-disorder-that-makes-people-not-to-have-sex-sexologist-claims'>No Valentine’s Day love? Guess who sex doc blames</a></h3><p>Just in time for Valentime's day, a sex therapist has some warm thoughts and a kooky theory for what may putting people out of the mood for love: It's mostly President Trump's fault, with a little help from racism and America's "war worship." Dr. Susan Block, a sex therapist known for her HBO appearances, best-selling books, and appearances on TV networks such as Oprah, believes if you're not getting intimate these days, it is all because of the negative vibes she sees emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. “It has had a big impact. For some people Trump's campaign and presidency has created a type of PTSD — what I call ‘Post-Trump Sex Disorder’,” she said during an interview with Salon, a liberal publication. “Trump has created feelings of fear, loathing, and nausea," she added. "People just don’t want to have sex.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-chicago-police-officer-jason-van-dyke-attacked-prison-wife-n971426'>Former Chicago police officer who killed Laquan McDonald attacked in prison</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-s-prince-philip-not-face-charges-after-crash-near-n971416'>Queen's 97-year-old husband will not face charges after crash near royal estate</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/infowars-host-alex-jones-be-deposed-defamation-suit-brought-sandy-n971421'>Infowars host to be deposed in defamation suit brought by Sandy Hook parents</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/philippine-journalist-duterte-critic-posts-bail-after-libel-arrest-causes-n971411'>Journalist and Duterte critic posts bail after arrest causes outcry</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/friendly-fire-death-nyc-officer-leads-murder-charges-robbery-suspect-n971396'>'Friendly fire' death of officer leads to murder charges for suspect with fake gun</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-california-governor-feud-twitter-over-bullet-train-n971391'>Trump, California governor trade barbed tweets over bullet train money</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/navy-officer-guilty-manslaughter-san-diego-bridge-plunge-killed-4-n971386'>Navy officer guilty of manslaughter in bridge plunge that killed 4</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/over-1-800-dairy-cows-killed-freak-blizzard-washington-state-n971371'>Over 1,800 dairy cows killed in freak blizzard, hurting struggling farmers</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/tom-barrack-trump-donor-khashoggi/index.html'>Trump inaugural chief jokes and then defends Saudis on Khashoggi murder</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/opinions/planned-parenthood-abortion-access-wen/index.html'>Opinion: Here's what gives Planned Parenthood's president hope</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/darla-shine-measles-anti-vaccination/index.html'>Wife of White House communications director pushes false anti-vaccination claims</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/media/trump-russia-poll-question/index.html'>How a single poll question illustrates America's divide over Trump and Russia </a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/brock-long-fema/index.html'>FEMA administrator resigns</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/13/acosta-trump-rally-el-paso-cameraman-attacked-sot-vpx.cnn'>Acosta: Trump rallies worse than they look</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/trump-golf-simulator/index.html'>Washington Post: Trump spent $50K on golf simulator for White House</a></h3></div></body>
