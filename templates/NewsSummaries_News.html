Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Saikat Chakrabarti, the progressive firebrand's multimillionaire chief of staff, apparently violated campaign finance law by funneling nearly $1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies that he also controlled, according to an explosive complaint filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and obtained by Fox News. Amid the allegations, a former FEC commissioner late Monday suggested in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation that Ocasio-Cortez and her team could separately be facing major fines and potentially even jail time if they were knowingly and willfully violating the law by hiding their control of the Justice Democrats political action committee (PAC). Such an arrangement could have allowed Ocasio-Cortez's campaign to receive donations in excess of the normal limit, by pooling contributions to both the PAC and the campaign itself. The FEC complaint asserts that Chakrabarti established two PACs, the Brand New Congress PAC and Justice Democrats PAC, and then systematically transfered more than $885,000 in contributions received by those PACs to the Brand New Campaign LLC and the Brand New Congress LLC -- companies that, unlike PACs, are exempt from reporting all of their significant expenditures.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-cat-blog-buzzfeed-false-trump-dossier-cohen-reports-show-how-u-s-media-have-changed-forever'>Fox News: TUCKER CARLSON: How BuzzFeed’s dossier, Cohen reporting changed rules</a></h3><p>Meow! The Mueller investigation itself batted down BuzzFeed's story almost immediately after it came out, and yet, BuzzFeed never retracted the piece. Once again, in its feline way, the site pretended that nothing had happened. You can yell at a cat, but you can't make a cat pay attention it turns out. We have seen an awful lot of change during the two years Trump has been president.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/robin-roberts-on-jussie-smollett-interview-it-was-a-no-win-situation-for-me'>Fox News: Robin Roberts opens up about how she really felt about Smollett interview</a></h3><p>“Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts is opening up about her interview with Jussie Smollett, calling the sit-down "a no-win situation." During The Cut's "How I Get It Done" event on Monday, Roberts, 58, admitted that she initially wasn't sure she wanted to proceed with the segment. “I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” she recalled, according to Page Six. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.' And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.” Per The Hollywood Reporter, Roberts said Smollett's team told her that she could challenge the "Empire" actor on what she saw as "red flags" in the alleged attack and that the 36-year-old would also give her new information he hadn't said anywhere else.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/halle-berry-shows-off-massive-new-tattoo-who-says-im-not-a-mermaid-she-says'>Fox News: Actress stuns fans with topless picture flaunting new tattoo</a></h3><p>Star actress Halle Berry revealed a massive back tattoo in a topless Instagram photo Monday. The new ink featured a long vine with leaves on both sides running down her spine from the top of her neck to her lower back. "Who says I'm not a mermaid," she wrote, including a mermaid emoji. Berry, 52, was wearing a shimmering, mermaid-colored sequin skirt, while standing in front of a stove. She appeared to be holding a skillet above the fire on her right hand and an egg on top of her head with her left hand.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wwe-legend-king-kong-bundy-dies-at-61'>Fox News: WWE’s legendary, 450-pound heel King Kong Bundy dead at 61</a></h3><p>Former WWE legend King Kong Bundy has died, the wrestling company announced Tuesday. He was 61. The New Jersey native, whose real name is Christopher Pallies, was known for his enormous stature inside the ring. He was 6-foot-4 and 458 pounds and also known as the “walking condominium.” Part of his gimmick was having referees count to five, instead of three, when he pinned an opponent to show that there was no way they would get up from his destruction. One of his biggest moments in WWE was wrestling Hulk Hogan for the WWE title inside a steel cage at Wrestlemania 2.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/over-1-500-exotic-turtles-found-inside-luggage-philippines-n979281'>Over 1,500 exotic turtles found inside luggage in Philippines</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/oregon-sen-jeff-merkley-passes-white-house-bid-seek-re-n979216'>Oregon Sen.
