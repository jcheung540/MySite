Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign spokesman unloaded on Hillary Clinton and her team on Monday, calling them the "biggest a--holes in American politics," after former members of Clinton's campaign leaked details this week about Sanders' use of private jets to attend campaign rallies on her behalf. Speaking to Politico, the spokesman, Michael Briggs, proceeded to call Clinton's staff "total ingrates," given that Sanders claims he billed the Clinton-Kaine campaign for private air travel in order to attend events that he otherwise would have needed to skip. “You can see why she’s one of the most disliked politicians in America," Briggs said, referring to Clinton. Her people are not nice.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-how-dumb-arrogant-ocasio-cortez-became-the-boss-of-the-democratic-party'>TUCKER CARLSON: How AOC became the boss of the Democratic Party</a></h3><p>Because you're not. It's a measure of how cowardly impassive everyone has become all of a sudden that a chorus of right-thinking Democrats hasn't told this idiotic windbag to be quiet and take a seat. Don't talk until you learn something. But of course nobody has done that they are all too afraid of her. Republicans have described Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as the leader of her party, the boss of the Democratic Party.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russian-tv-lists-potential-nuclear-strike-targets-in-us-after-putin-warning'>Russian state TV takes unusual step to list potential US nuclear strike locations</a></h3><p>Russian state TV on Sunday listed potential targets in the U.S. in the event of a nuclear strike and claimed that its new hypersonic missile technology could reach them in less than five minutes. Reuters called the report “unusual even by the sometimes bellicose standards of Russian state TV.” The targets included the Pentagon and Camp David. The report came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the U.S. against deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe. Putin reaffirmed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles in Europe, but warned that it will retaliate if the U.S. puts such missiles on the continent. He said it will not only target the host countries but field new weapons that will target U.S. decision-making centers.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-posts-about-special-moment-with-cooper-during-academy-awards'>Songstress posts about 'special' moment with Cooper at Academy Awards</a></h3><p>LOS ANGELES – Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s Academy Awards performance of “Shallow” left social media abuzz on Sunday night, and the Oscar-winning songstress is apparently still thinking of the duet nearly 24 hours later. Gaga posted a picture of the two onstage sitting in front of the Steinway & Sons piano. Cooper's hand is wrapped around her waist and their hands were interwoven. She posted, "Nothing could be more special than sharing this moment at the Oscars with a true friend and artistic genius." The performance contained some seriously intense eye contact between the pair, who starred as the star-crossed Jackson Maine and Ally in “A Star is Born,” which won the Academy Award for best original song at the ceremony.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/singer-bebe-rexhas-father-pleads-daughter-to-stop-posting-stupid-pornography'>Singer's father pleads for her to 'stop posting stupid pornography': report</a></h3><p>Bebe Rexha's father was reportedly not a fan of a recent Instagram post from his daughter. In the since-deleted screenshot message, the Grammy-nominated singer's dad, Flamur Rexha, pleaded with her to stop posting pictures and videos that he described as "pornography." "You better stop posting stupid pornography because you make me sick," he wrote. '"I can't take this anymore.
