But the elimination of air travel strikes particularly close to the homes of Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris – all of whom extensively used air travel, including private jets – throughout the years in office. Harris, among the leading Democratic candidates in the 2020 race so far, has been an early backer of Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution to tackle climate change by radically transforming the country by rendering air travel obsolete, moving the U.S. to rely completely on renewable energy with net-zero emissions, and guaranteeing economic security even for people who are “unwilling” to work. “I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/father-of-missing-nursing-student-maura-murray-believes-new-info-will-lead-to-her-remains-15-years-later'>Missing student’s dad suspects her remains are under basement floor</a></h3><p>The father of a nursing student who went missing after crashing her car in New Hampshire in 2004 believes newly gathered information will lead to her remains. Fred Murray believes his daughter, Maura Murray, who was 21 when she disappeared, is dead. The University of Massachusetts-Amherst nursing student left campus on Feb. 9, 2004 and drove to New Hampshire. She crashed her car on a road in Woodsville, N.H., and vanished. Her car was later found.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/science/rare-powder-horn-that-belonged-to-african-american-revolutionary-war-soldier-goes-on-display'>Powder horn belonging to Revolutionary War soldier goes on display</a></h3><p>A rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War has gone on display in Philadelphia. The elaborately carved cow’s horn belonged to Gershom Prince, who served as an aide to Captain Durkee of the 4th Connecticut Regiment during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. The horn, which was used to store gunpowder, is carved with Prince’s name and images that include trees and forts. The artifact will be on display at the Museum of the American Revolution through the end of 2019. Prince, who experts believe was likely a free man, survived the battles of Germantown and Brandywine as well as the harsh winter encampment at Valley Forge.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nuclear-scientist-recalls-how-romance-with-con-man-turned-dark-in-doc-it-put-the-fear-of-god-in-me'>Victim: Dream man was smart, generous - but then something felt very wrong</a></h3><p>Linda Dyas’ quest for love turned into a nightmare. The 49-year-old nuclear scientist is one of nine women who came forward for Oxygen’s new documentary “Seduced By Evil,” which details how con man Derek Alldred romanced more than two dozen women out of a reported $2 million. The 49-year-old con artist targeted intelligent but vulnerable single women looking for long-term relationships. Alldred took on false identities and wore costumes to charm women, including dressing up as an Afghanistan veteran in full uniform. Once Alldred lured his victims, he would then entangled the women in a web of lies to deplete their savings, leaving them behind in financial ruin.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/first-born-only-child-middle-child-what-birth-order-reveals-about-you-and-why-you-should-care'>KEVIN LEMAN: Here’s what your birth order says about you</a></h3><p>Which description is most like you? 1: A natural leader and perfectionist, you are logical, technical, well-organized, conscientious, a good reader, and a list-maker.
