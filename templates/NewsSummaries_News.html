Trump initially blamed North Korea for demanding too much in sanction relief that would only come with total denuclearization. Trump said last week simply that he “had to walk away” from the table. Trump was asked about the Cohen hearing on Thursday while in Hanoi and said “having it [the hearing] in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing.” Trump was apparently still considering where the summit went wrong on Sunday night and tweeted, “For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with north Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the “walk.” Never done when a president is overseas.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-socialism-vs-the-american-way-of-life-will-be-on-the-2020-ballot'>Fox News: LIZ PEEK: The American way of life is on the line in 2020</a></h3><p>The 2020 election will be the most important of our lifetime. You hear that from politicians every two years; this time it’s true. The American way of life is going to be on the ballot in 2020.

Among the other fatalities was an 8-year-old girl, according to rescue officials. Her identity was not released. Unconfirmed reports identified a 6-year-old boy as another victim. Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told WRBL-TV that the tornado traveled along a state road in Beauregard and that the path of destruction appeared at least a mile long and a quarter mile wide.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/comedian-trevor-noah-slammed-as-racist-for-india-pakistan-joke'>Fox News: 'Daily Show' host slammed by critics as 'racist' for India-Pakistan joke</a></h3><p>Trevor Noah, the host of “The Daily Show,” raised eyebrows after he joked that a war between Pakistan and India would “probably be the most entertaining” of all time, saying that Indian soldiers would enter battle dancing Bollywood style. “It would be the longest war of all time,” he said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “Another dance number?” Swara Bhasker, an Indian actress, called Noah’s comments “ignorant and racist.” She reportedly said, “Ur set smacks of essentialism & a patronizing generalization.” Another Indian comedian wrote, “If you’re going to be a racist comic than at least get the comic bit right.” Most of the comments were posted on Twitter. Noah responded to one, “I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that’s not what I was trying to do.” At least eight civilians and two soldiers have been killed in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir since tensions soared following India’s airstrike last Tuesday inside Pakistan.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-and-kate-beckinsale-show-major-pda-at-rangers-game'>Fox News: 'SNL' comedian heats up romance with actress at NHL game</a></h3><p>Hockey brings everyone closer together. On Sunday, Kate Beckinsale and Pete Davidson were photographed as they headed to Madison Square Garden, where the New York Rangers faced the Washington Capitals. Rocking a black trench coat with dark jeans and sunglasses, Beckinsale, 45, kept close to Davidson, 25, who paired his light blue shirt with jeans and a dark baseball cap. The duo was later spotted sitting behind the Rangers bench inside the arena, according to photos published by TMZ. Unfortunately for the Rangers, Beckinsale and Davidson didn’t bring the home team much luck as they fell to the Capitals in overtime, 3-2.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-eye-gop-playbook-justice-department-requests-n978751'>MSNBC: House Democrats eye GOP playbook for Justice Department requests</a></h3><p>WASHINGTON — Democrats who now wield gavels and subpoena power in the U.S. House of Representatives have not been shy in faulting their Republican counterparts for shirking oversight responsibility when they were in control over the past two years. But there’s one key area — with potentially significant ramifications for the public’s understanding of the Mueller investigation — on which they agree: the GOP’s dogged and largely successful pursuit of sensitive documents from the Justice Department. As the special counsel probe nears its conclusion and lawmakers still uncertain about just how much of Mueller’s work will be made public, Democrats are considering a number of political and legal pressure points previously employed by Republicans to try and extract materials from the Justice Department it otherwise might be loath to reveal voluntarily, setting up what could be a significant constitutional clash with the Trump administration over executive privilege and separation of powers. You might call it the Devin Nunes playbook, based on tactics employed by the former House Intelligence Committee chairman and other GOP committee leaders to use subpoena power, threats of contempt and even impeachment to coerce the Justice Department into an unprecedented series of disclosures of materials related to both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and key aspects of the Russia investigation itself.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Dallas-Curfew-to-Take-Effect-Monday-506634341.html'>MSNBC: Watered-down curfew for teens takes effect in Dallas</a></h3><p>A new Dallas teen curfew takes effect Monday, after the city council voted Wednesday to reinstate a law that expired in January. The Dallas City Council allowed the curfew, which applied to kids under 17 years old, to expire last month, as leaders considered options that potentially involved doing away with it for good. Instead, the council passed an amended version of the old law, crafted by councilman Adam McGough. The amendments include a directive to police officers to issue a citation as a last resort, instead they are instructed to bring kids home to their parents. If a citation is issued, it would be handled as a civil, instead of a criminal, violation.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/03/04/kyler-murray-nfl-combine-notes-fmia-peter-king/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>MSNBC: Peter King: Kyler Murray is Combine's No. 1 story, and might be the No. 1 pick</a></h3><p>3. 4. 5.

The Oakland Education Association voted in favor of the deal on Sunday after having postponed the vote for a day. The agreement must also be ratified by the Oakland Unified School District. "We look forward to being in our classrooms again after having to strike to bring our Oakland students some of the resources and supports they should have had in the first place," Keith Brown, the union's president, said in a statement. The agreement was reached after 3,000 teachers went on strike on Feb. 21, prompting seven days of marathon negotiations for higher pay, smaller classes and more school resources.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/03/03/bryce-harper-says-he-will-be-ready-for-opening-day/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>MSNBC: Despite late start, Bryce Harper says he'll be ready for Opening Day</a></h3><p>Outfielder Bryce Harper inked a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies on Thursday, more than two weeks after pitchers and catchers reported to Clearwater, Florida. Despite the late start, Harper says he will be ready for Opening Day, MLB.com’s Todd Zolecki reports. The Phillies have played 11 Grapefruit League games thus far, including split-squad games. They have 22 more.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the latest charges against 59-year-old Stephen Beal will be detailed Monday. Agents were searching Beal’s Long Beach home after he was arrested on Sunday morning, she said. Beal was charged last year with being in possession of an unregistered destructive device after a May 15 explosion killed Beal’s ex-girlfriend, Ildiko Krajnyak, 48, at her Orange County spa. Two of Krajnyak’s employees were also injured after opening a box that exploded.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/suspect-charged-death-woman-who-vanished-after-leaving-boston-nightclub-n978741'>MSNBC: Suspect charged in death of woman who vanished after leaving nightclub</a></h3><p>A Rhode Island man was charged with the death of a woman who vanished after leaving a Boston nightclub last month, federal authorities said Sunday. The suspect, Louis D. Coleman III, 32, was charged with kidnapping resulting in death, said Andrew Lelling, United States Attorney for Massachusetts. Jassy Correia, 23, was last seen by friends celebrating her birthday at the Venu nightclub shortly after midnight on Feb. 24, NBC Boston reported. She was reported missing the next day, after her father and brother couldn't reach her. Correia's body was found in the trunk of Coleman’s sedan in Delaware four days later, Lelling said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccarthy-says-hush-payments-aren-t-impeachable-offenses-n978661'>MSNBC: McCarthy says hush payments aren't impeachable offenses</a></h3><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told ABC's "This Week" that the hush payments President Donald Trump's former longtime attorney Michael Cohen made to two women before the 2016 presidential election "aren't impeachable" offenses. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to a pair of campaign-finance violations among a longer list of felony charges. Those violations stemmed from hush money payments he made just before the 2016 election to silence two women who allege past affairs with Trump. Federal prosecutors alleged that Trump directed those payments. This week, during his public testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Cohen provided a pair of checks he said were reimbursements he received in 2017 for the hush payment to one of the women, porn star Stormy Daniels.</p><br><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.comhttp://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/john-hickenlooper-presidential-campaign/index.html'>Former Colorado Gov.
