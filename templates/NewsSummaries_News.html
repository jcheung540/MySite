Newly released internal FBI emails showed the agency's highest-ranking officials scrambling to answer to Hillary Clinton's lawyer in the days prior the 2016 presidential election, on the same day then-FBI Director James Comey sent a bombshell letter to Congress announcing a new review of hundreds of thousands of potentially classified emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop. The trove of documents turned over by the FBI, in response to a lawsuit by the transparency group Judicial Watch, also included discussions by former FBI lawyer Lisa Page concerning a potential quid-pro-quo between the State Department and the FBI -- in which the FBI would agree to downgrade the classification level of a Clinton email in exchange for more legal attache positions that would benefit the agency abroad. There was no indication such a quid-pro-quo ever took place.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-mike-braun-lets-drain-the-swamp-and-end-taxpayer-funded-congressional-pensions'>SEN. MIKE BRAUN: Drain swamp, end cushy retirement perks for lawmakers</a></h3><p>These generous congressional perks incentivize political survival over bold leadership and it’s time we end this congressional benefit for everyone. Before my election to the U.S. Senate last year, I spent 37 years building a business in my hometown of Jasper, Indiana. Since taking office, I’ve found one thing abundantly clear: Main Street works and Washington is completely dysfunctional. On Friday, the government could shut down again because Congress can’t find a solution to address the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. That’s why this week I’m introducing my End Pensions in Congress (EPIC) Act.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rashida-tlaib-once-wrote-column-for-nation-of-islams-publication-reprinting-farrakhans-anti-semitic-comments'>Freshman congresswoman penned article in Farrakhan publication</a></h3><p>Freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib once wrote a column for the Final Call, an official publication of the Nation of Islam and its notorious leader Louis Farrakhan. Tlaib, a Palestinian American, has been facing criticism ever since her arrival in Congress and promise to impeach President Trump using profane language. She later came under bipartisan criticism from Jewish groups for appearing with radical anti-Israel activists during her swearing in ceremony in Michigan, with some activists previously praising terror group Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorists, and saying that Israel has no right to exist. But it now has been unearthed that she was a guest contributor in 2006 to the publication that reprints Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic comments and offers their defense.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/human-foot-washes-on-canadian-beach-15th-overall-since-2007-police-say'>15th shoe with severed foot found on Northwest shoreline</a></h3><p>Canadian authorities on Monday said that they were unable to identify the person whose foot was found last year on the Vancouver shoreline that was in blue socks and a grey Nike sneaker. The foot, which was discovered in September 2018, is the 15th time in just over a decade that a human foot was discovered on the British Columbia shoreline. More than half of those feet were determined to have belonged to people who either died by accident or committed suicide while the remaining third remain unidentified, according to the B.C. Coroners Service. The coroner's service has determined that the latest foot belonged to a man but have been unable to match its DNA with any databases.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wwe-star-paige-talks-sex-tape-says-i-dont-wish-that-for-anyone'>WWE star talks 'public humiliation' over sex tape, her comeback</a></h3><p>She was once one of the biggest stars in the pro wrestling business, but by 2017, she had become depressed and nearly suicidal. She locked herself away from the public and her family. She became sickly and was treated for anorexia. Her hair started falling out. But a chance encounter with a young fan at a grocery store turned it all around for Paige.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-supporter-accused-violently-shoving-journalists-el-paso-rally-n970451'>Trump supporter accused of shoving journalists at El Paso rally</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/french-journalists-suspended-over-alleged-cyberbullying-n970456'>French journalists suspended over alleged cyberbullying</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-delhi-hotel-fire-kills-least-17-people-n970441'>17 killed as blaze rips through budget hotel in New Delhi</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/02/12/westbrook-sets-new-triple-double-record-in-thunder-win/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Russell Westbrook sets new triple-double record in Thunder win</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-s-artificial-intelligence-order-lacks-funding-not-target-china-n970406'>Trump's artificial intelligence order lacks funding but not a target — China</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/winter-storm-sweeping-across-midwest-expected-hit-east-coast-overnight-n970356'>Winter storm could cause chaos for commuters from Illinois to Maine</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/teens-defying-their-parents-get-vaccinated-amid-measles-outbreak-n970341'>As measles surge, some unvaccinated teens are seeking shots</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-man-enters-abandoned-home-smoke-weed-finds-tiger-instead-n970411'>Texas man enters abandoned home to smoke weed, finds tiger instead</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/trump-elizabeth-warren-racist-tweets/index.html'>Trump's racist Warren taunts have entered a new phase</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/11/donald-trump-jr-savage-trail-of-tears-tweet-jake-tapper-vpx.cnn'>Tapper on Donald Trump Jr.: That is blatant racism</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/2020-democratic-announcements-kamala-harris-amy-klobuchar-cory-booker/index.html'>Analysis: The 2020 Democratic announcements, ranked</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/2020-democrats-israel/index.html'>Democrats forced to confront growing divide over Israel heading into 2020</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/donald-trump-hard-work/index.html'>Analysis: Donald Trump is obsessed with how hard he works</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/dons-take-ralph-northam-race-blackface-cbs-face-the-nation-sot-ctn-vpx.cnn'>Northam interview leaves Don Lemon speechless</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/michael-cohen-postpones-congressional-testimony/index.html'>Michael Cohen postpones congressional testimony for a third time</a></h3></div></body>
