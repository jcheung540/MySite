Trump, speaking in Hanoi, Vietnam, told reporters he had asked Kim to do more regarding his intentions to denuclearize, and “he was unprepared to do that.” “Sometimes you have to walk,” Trump said at a solo press conference following the summit. Trump specifically said negotiations fell through after the North demanded a full removal of U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of the North's Yongbyon nuclear facility. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the United States wasn't willing to make a deal without the North committing to giving up its secretive nuclear facilities outside Yongbyon, as well as its missile and warheads program.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kim-jong-un-may-not-even-need-a-nuclear-deterrent-anymore-thanks-to-this-stunning-weapon'>REBECCA GRANT: Why North Korea leader may not need nuclear deterrent</a></h3><p>Although there was no agreement reached between President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at their summit in Vietnam on denuclearization by the North, we shouldn’t write off the possibility of an agreement in the future. One reason for this is that Kim may not even need a nuclear deterrent any more. He’s got a stunning weapon that’s not even on the negotiating table: cyber, and an army of 6,000 hackers supported by China. North Korea set up its first cyberunit in 1998. Back then, they weren’t that good; U.S. military officials scoffed that North Korea was the only country without a laptop.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-jim-acosta-complains-he-wasnt-called-on-by-trump-for-question-at-news-coference-after-ned-of-us-north-korea-summit'>Trump nemesis Acosta complains of being snubbed at Hanoi presser</a></h3><p>CNN’s Jim Acosta on Thursday bemoaned the fact that President Trump didn’t call on him during a news conference after the abrupt end of the Hanoi summit between the U.S. and North Korea. During a segment following the news conference, Acosta asserted that Trump may have avoided White House press corps journalists in an effort to dodge questions about Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, who testified Wednesday on the Capitol Hill. “First of all, we have to point out the obvious, which is the president steered clear largely during this news conference of the White House press corps and instead selected journalists at random from the other side of the room, where foreign journalists were seated,” Acosta said. But Acosta didn't mention that Trump called on at least two journalists from the White House press corps, including CBS’s Major Garrett – who was the first reporter called on – and ABC News’ Jonathan Karl, who quizzed Trump on Cohen’s testimony.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/michael-cohen-says-hes-a-fool-no-one-can-argue-with-that'>JASON CHAFFETZ: The one thing convicted liar Michael Cohen got right</a></h3><p>The Justice Department was right to prosecute him. Asked by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., how he sees himself, President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen responded Wednesday that he sees himself as “a fool.” At least we know he told the truth in answering that question. In a pointless hearing in which Cohen testified before the House Oversight and Reform Committee making multiple unproven accusations against President Trump, the public got to see what Special Counsel Robert Mueller apparently saw: no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. What we all saw instead was a fool. We witnessed exactly what Mueller and his team ultimately concluded after spending about $25 million and almost two years on this investigation: Cohen is a liar, untrustworthy, crooked and in violation of the law.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/hoa-threatens-resident-with-fine-after-car-leaves-penis-shape-in-snow-report'>SEE THE PIC: HOA threatens fine over shape car left in snow</a></h3><p>A homeowner’s association (HOA) in Tennessee threatened to fine a resident $100 after her car left a phallic-shaped image in the condo’s parking lot following a light dusting of snow, a report said Tuesday. The resident, identified as Kathryn, told The Drive that in January she received a surprising email from her HOA accusing her of violating the rules by “displaying offensive images or slogans.” The board didn’t specify what was “offensive,” so a confused Kathryn inquired further. The board claimed to have photographic evidence sent in by a resident who was concerned about the wellbeing of children, the outlet reported. The photo it sent left Kathryn in stitches: a snowy parking space with a blob of cleared asphalt that could be construed as male genitalia. The absence of tire tracks was because it was still snowing when she and her husband left for work that morning in their Honda Insight, Kathryn told The Drive.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/virginia-first-lady-pam-northam-apologizes-after-handing-cotton-black-n977546'>Virginia first lady apologizes after handing cotton to black children</a></h3><p>Virginia first lady Pam Northam apologized Wednesday after she handed out cotton to black children during a recent tour of the governor's mansion, the latest racial controversy involving the top levels of the state' government. "I regret that I have upset anyone," Northam said. "I am still committed to chronicling the important history of the Historic Kitchen, and will continue to engage historians and experts on the best way to do so in the future." Her apology came after a Virginia state employee complained to lawmakers and Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's office about the first lady having handed out cotton to her eighth-grade daughter and another black child during a recent tour, asking them to imagine picking the crop as enslaved Africans, The Washington Post reported.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/indian-pilot-be-released-peace-gesture-pakistan-prime-minister-says-n977536'>Indian pilot to be released as peace gesture, Pakistan prime minister says</a></h3><p>ISLAMABAD — Prime Minister Imran Khan says Pakistan will release the captured Indian pilot as a "peace gesture" toward India. Khan made this announcement Thursday while addressing lawmakers in both chambers of parliament, convened to discuss the latest situation amid rising tensions with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Khan says he tried to reach his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Wednesday with a message that he wants to de-escalate tension. Khan did not say how India responded to his initiative. He also reiterated his offer for talks to New Delhi, saying this is the only way to solve all issues.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kushner-meets-mohammed-bin-salman-erdogan-push-mideast-plan-n977521'>Kushner meets Saudi crown prince, Turkish leader to push Mideast peace plan</a></h3><p>White House adviser Jared Kushner continued a whirlwind overseas trip Wednesday aimed at rallying U.S. allies to support his still-unannounced Mideast peace plan. Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, met with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman this week. He arrived in Turkey on Wednesday. He last toured the region for peace talks in June. Palestinians have refused to discuss any peace blueprint with the United States in the wake of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017, while some Arab leaders have publicly rejected any deal that fails to address Jerusalem's status or refugees' right of return.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-security-forces-should-face-justice-gaza-killings-u-n-n977526'>Israel security forces should face justice for Gaza killings, U.N. report says</a></h3><p>GENEVA — United Nations investigators said on Thursday that Israeli security forces may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in killing 189 Palestinians and wounding more than 6,100 at weekly protests in Gaza last year. The independent panel said it had confidential information about those it believes to be responsible for the killings, including snipers and commanders. "The Israeli security forces killed and maimed Palestinian demonstrators who did not pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury to others when they were shot, nor were they directly participating in hostilities," it said in its report. Israel rejected the report as a "theater of the absurd." In a statement, acting Foreign Minister Israel Katz called it "another hostile, mendacious and slanted report against the State of Israel ... No one can deny Israel the right of self-defense and the obligation to defend its citizens and borders from violent attacks."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctor-shot-patient-wheelchair-florida-va-hospital-fbi-says-n977506'>Doctor shot by patient in wheelchair in VA hospital, FBI says</a></h3><p>A doctor at a Florida hospital for veterans was shot by a patient, a double amputee in a wheelchair, as the patient was taken to the emergency room Wednesday evening, officials said. Larry Ray Bon, 59, of Michigan, opened fire with a handgun about 6:20 p.m. at West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, Justin Fleck, assistant special agent in charge at the Miami FBI Office, said at a news conference Wednesday night. The doctor was struck while attempting to subdue the man. "It was very brave,” Fleck said of the doctor, who has not been identified. “He was pretty heroic and probably saved a lot of lives."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/12-treated-after-strange-odor-forces-alaska-airlines-flight-divert-n977476'>12 treated after strange odor on Alaska Airlines flight</a></h3><p>A Seattle-bound Alaska Airlines flight from Chicago was diverted to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Wednesday night after a strange odor was detected and a dozen people on board reported breathing issues, officials said. The source of the odor on the Boeing 737-900, which had 144 on board, has not been determined. Four crew members were hospitalized, and another six were examined after the 7:17 p.m. landing, the airline said in a statement. Two passengers were also evaluated at the airport, Alaska Airline said. A spokesman for the airport, Patrick Hogan, said by email that the patients complained of "respiratory issues."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreaks-lawmakers-tackle-vaccine-misinformation-conspiracies-n977261'>Measles outbreaks: Lawmakers tackle anti-vaccine conspiracies</a></h3><p>As cases of measles continue to rise across the United States, lawmakers met Wednesday to confront the growing public health threat. The sometimes raucous hearing, held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, laid out one of the main challenges: stopping the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation about the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine that have contributed to vaccine-hesitancy in many communities. At least twice, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., stopped the hearing when audience members, both for and against immunization, shouted down speakers over vaccine safety. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, acknowledged that there hasn’t been effective countering of the anti-vaccine movement. “Misinformation is an important problem,” Fauci said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-n-j-superintendent-who-defecated-public-says-police-shouldn-n976996'>Superintendent who defecated in public says police shouldn't have released mugshot</a></h3><p>A former school superintendent who was charged with defecating on a high school’s track has asked New Jersey’s attorney general to investigate whether police acted unlawfully when they took his mugshot and released it to the media. The Holmdel Township Police Department's "actions were the height of willful misconduct, professional irresponsibility and a total disdain for the law,” attorney Matthew Adams said Monday in a letter to Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. Thomas Tramaglini was charged with lewdness, littering and defecating in public in May after police said he repeatedly defecated on the Holmdel High School track. Tramaglini pleaded guilty in October to relieving himself in public once in the midst of a medical emergency and paid a $500 fine. Tramaglini submitted to the court and prosecutor's office proof of a medical condition known as runner's diarrhea that often affects distance runners and that is brought on from acute blood flow during exercise.</p><br><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/timeline-michael-cohen-trump-financial-records/index.html'>A timeline of Cohen's allegations of Trump inflating his net worth</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-house-intelligence-committee/index.html'>Cohen to testify behind closed doors today</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/michael-cohen-testimony-congress-cuomo-lemon-handoff-cpt-sot-vpx.cnn'>Cuomo and Lemon call out GOP hypocrisy</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/27/elijah-cummings-closing-michael-cohen-testimony-sot-vpx.cnn'>You need to listen to Rep.
