Evoking the 25th Amendment, Dershowitz added, would be a fundamental misuse of its original purpose. He said it was originally "about Woodrow Wilson having a stroke. It’s about a president being shot and not being able to perform his office."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/michael-knowles'>MICHAEL KNOWLES: Dems campaign like 2020 is a high school election</a></h3><p>Sen. Kamala Harris of California says she loved to smoke the Devil’s Lettuce in college, especially while jamming to Tupac and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has little or no Native American ancestry, despite decades of claiming American Indian heritage for professional advantage, but she believes strongly in “the importance of lifting up and celebrating Native voices,” as she herself will tell you ad nauseam. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey wants you to adopt his faddish diet lest the world’s upwardly mobile hordes “destroy our planet” by eating meat. And when former U.S. House member and defeated Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke isn’t skateboarding through fast food parking lots, he passes his unemployed hours writing angsty public diary entries. He’s “been stuck lately,” you see, “in and out of a funk.” These puerile Democratic politicians appear more inclined to run for president of their high school class than president of the United States.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-warns-republicans-trumps-national-emergency-sets-precedent-for-future-democratic-administrations'>Top Dem warns future president could declare gun violence an emergency</a></h3><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Thursday theorized that if President Trump can declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress to fund a border wall, there's no reason that a Democratic president in the future can't employ the same measure to deal with gun violence in the country. Pelosi made the remarks during a press conference in the Capitol Thursday – the anniversary of the Parkland massacre in Florida that left 17 people dead. "Let's talk about today: The one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America," Pelosi said. "That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-wrapped-dogs-legs-and-mouth-shut-before-throwing-it-out-of-vehicle-cops'>GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING: Dog found duct-taped, freezing on roadside</a></h3><p>A Missouri man wrapped the legs and mouth of a dachshund with duct tape before dumping it in a ditch where it remained for 12 hours in freezing temperatures before being rescued, authorities said. The suspect, identified as Paul Garcia, 39, threw the dog from his vehicle in Jefferson County, a Thursday release from the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office read. He faces felony animal abuse and armed criminal action charges and was being held on $50,000 bail. A sheriff’s deputy found the black and brown dog – named “Jimmy" by workers at the hospital where he was taken -- while on patrol Saturday morning. Paul Garcia, 39, faces felony animal abuse and armed criminal action charges, authorities say.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/youtuber-furry-potato-shot-while-filming-los-angeles-synagogue'>YouTube star shot while live-streaming outside synagogue; guard arrested</a></h3><p>A transgender YouTube personality who goes by the name “Furry Potato” was shot outside a Los Angeles synagogue on Thursday after arguing with a security guard, according to police reports and social media footage. The 45-year-old victim, a self-proclaimed “1st Amendment auditor,” whose real name is Zhoie Perez, live-streamed the incident in two separate videos outside the Etz Jacob synagogue. In the footage, Perez appears to roam around the synagogue for about 30 minutes while a security guard questions her. The guard advises her not “to do anything crazy over here,” before going back inside the synagogue. Perez then films the guard standing behind the gate, zooming in and out on the guard's firearm and uniform but not saying anything.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/michael-avenatti-says-he-has-new-video-evidence-against-r-n971941'>Michael Avenatti says he has new video evidence against R.
