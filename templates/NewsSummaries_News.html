Tom Cotton unloaded on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal and said the media were “complicit” in burying the most radical parts of the deal. Cotton, a staunch Republican, appeared on The Hugh Hewitt Show on Tuesday and discussed the widely ridiculed Green New Deal that aims to implement sweeping changes across the nation. But what particularly caught Cotton’s eye was how the media became complicit in hiding the now-infamous FAQ document circulated by the Ocasio-Cortez office, which included lines such as promising a job to “all people of the United States” – including those “unwilling to work” – and making air travel industry obsolete. “I understand the Democrats that proposed this immediately tried to retract that white paper that went along with their resolution,” Cotton added.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-trump-attorney-john-dowd-slams-waste-of-time-mueller-probe-as-one-of-the-greatest-frauds-in-us-history'>Trump’s former lawyer has explosive prediction for Mueller report</a></h3><p>Veteran criminal defense attorney John Dowd has savaged Robert Mueller’s Russia probe as a "terrible waste of time" and questioned whether a report will ever be produced. Dowd, who served as a member of President Donald Trump’s legal team from June 2017 until March 2018, made the explosive comments during an interview with ABC News. “I will be shocked, if anything regarding the president is made public, other than, ‘we’re done’,” the 77-year-old said. This is one of the greatest frauds this country's ever seen “I know exactly what he has.

Guzman was convicted Tuesday in Brooklyn, N.Y., of running a massive drug smuggling operation as head of Mexico’s notorious and murderous Sinaloa Cartel. As a result, he is more than likely destined for ADX Florence — dubbed the "Alcatraz of the Rockies" — when he is sentenced in June, given his background of prison break-outs. Fremont County, CO, USA - February 9, 2015: The United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in unincorporated Fremont County, Colorado.

Daniel Goldsmith, 33, of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., told the Sacramento Bee that he is the one with the white "Build the Wall" No. 19 jersey, while his friend Pete Molinelli wore a black jersey with No. 1 that said "Trump." Goldsmith said the pair did it just for laughs.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miranda-lambert-dumps-salad-on-woman-during-argument-report'>Country music star dumps food on diner during heated altercation: report</a></h3><p>Country singer Miranda Lambert on Tuesday reportedly tossed her salad onto a woman during a heated argument at a Nashville restaurant. “The House That Built Me” singer was dining with her mother and a family friend at the Stoney River Steakhouse when an older man started the fight, TMZ reported. The man had begun the altercation with Lambert’s male friend in the men’s restroom over a statement about millennials and their cellphones, the outlet reported. When the man later approached Lambert’s table and started screaming, the two-time Grammy Award winner dumped a salad in his wife’s lap, according to TMZ. Police responded to a call at the restaurant about two men fighting, but Lambert’s party had gone by the time authorities arrived, according to the outlet.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/philippine-agents-arrest-journalist-critical-president-n970946'>Philippine agents arrest journalist critical of president</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/usc-agrees-215-million-settlement-reforms-over-doctor-abuse-allegations-n970931'>USC agrees to $215 million settlement, reforms over doctor abuse allegations</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dozens-members-arkansas-white-supremacist-gang-accused-meth-trafficking-n970926'>Dozens of members in white supremacist gang accused of meth trafficking</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-bahraini-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi-s-honeymoon-turned-extradition-n970911'>How one soccer player's honeymoon turned into an extradition nightmare</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2019/02/12/no-2-duke-erases-23-point-deficit-in-10-minutes-to-stun-no-16-louisville/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Duke stuns Louisville, making up 23 point deficit for the win</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-convicted-murdering-border-agent-case-revealed-fast-furious-operation-n970876'>Man convicted of killing border agent in 'Fast and Furious' case</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assaults-major-colleges-are-more-likely-be-campus-report-n970771'>Sexual assaults at major colleges are more likely off campus, report says</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/one-new-york-police-officer-dead-another-wounded-after-apparent-n970866'>N.Y. detective killed by 'friendly fire' during apparent armed robbery</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/howard-schultz-see-color/index.html'>Schultz: 'I honestly don't see color'</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/13/howard-schultz-texas-town-hall-2020-tax-returns-harlow-sot-vpx.cnn'>Billionaire pressed on his tax returns</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/cory-booker-vice-president-woman-maddow/index.html'>Booker will 'be looking to women first' when selecting VP running mate</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/trump-parade-july-4/index.html'>Trump floats new 'tradition:' 4th of July parade that already exists</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/trump-andrew-cuomo-meeting/index.html'>Trump, Cuomo discuss abortion, taxes, infrastructure in Oval Office meeting</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/john-dowd-robert-mueller-report-prediction-lead-vpx.cnn'>Trump's ex-lawyer makes 'startling' Mueller prediction</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/media/2019/02/13/late-night-colbert-trump-border-clinton-newday-vpx.cnn'>Colbert roasts Trump for using Hillary Clinton's slogan</a></h3></div></body>
