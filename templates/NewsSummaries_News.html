Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., sparked backlash Sunday evening from members of both parties -- including former first daughter Chelsea Clinton -- after she accused a prominent lobbying group of paying members of Congress to support Israel. Omar, who became the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress in November, responded to a Twitter post by journalist Glenn Greenwald criticizing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for threatening to take action against Omar and another freshman lawmaker, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., over allegedly anti-Semitic remarks. "There’s situations in our conference where a member does something that is wrong — I think you’ve seen from my own actions that I take action about it," McCarthy told reporters Friday, making an apparent reference to Republican congressman Steve King of Iowa. "I think when they stay silent, they are just as guilty ...</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/sheriffs-in-conservative-counties-in-washington-refuse-to-enforce-new-gun-law'>Sheriffs refuse to enforce state's strict, new gun laws</a></h3><p>Some sheriffs in several conservative Washington counties have refused to enforce the state’s sweeping restrictions on semi-automatic rifles until the courts decide whether they are constitutional. The November measure raised the minimum age for buying semi-automatic from 18 to 21, requires buyers to first pass a safety course and added expanded background checks and gun storage requirements. The National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing the measure is unconstitutional. Sheriffs in twelve, mostly rural, counties have decided not to enforce the law until the courts decide on the challenge, including Grant, Lincoln, Okanogan, Cowlitz, Douglas, Benton, Pacific, Stevens, Yakima, Wahkiakum, Mason and Klickitat. The police chief of Republic followed the sheriffs’ route.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-governor-to-reduce-national-guard-presence-at-border-with-mexico'>California governor sends message to Trump by yanking troops from border</a></h3><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is slated to pull several hundred National Guard troops from the state’s border with Mexico on Monday in an apparent rebuff to President Donald Trump’s characterization of the region being under siege by Central American refugees and migrants, according to reports. The move comes despite his predecessor’s agreement – along with other past and current border state governors – to send troops to the border at the Trump administration’s request. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown originally approved the mission through the end of March, but qualified that the state’s troops “will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.” Newsom’s plan will require the National Guard to immediately begin withdrawing troops but still give it until the end of March to do so.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-paper-drops-syndicated-cartoon-over-trump-insult'>Newspaper hands pink slip to cartoon strip over hidden vulgar Trump insult</a></h3><p>At least one newspaper says it has dropped the syndicated cartoon "Non Sequitur" after a vulgar message to President Donald Trump appeared in it. The Butler Eagle in Pennsylvania reported Sunday that the "shot at President Donald Trump" will cost cartoonist Wiley Miller "his place in the Eagle's Sunday comics." A scribbled message in one panel of that day's cartoon appears to begin with "We fondly say go ..." followed by the message to Trump. Ron Vodenichar, Eagle publisher and general manager, said in the paper that the paper was alerted about the message by a reader and included a syndicated comic strip. "Neither the Butler Eagle nor any other newspaper that includes this strip had an opportunity to remove it even if they had discovered it before distribution.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miley-cyrus-risks-wardrobe-malfunction-on-grammys-red-carpet'>Miley brings back topless look, risking Grammy 'malfunction'</a></h3><p>Miley Cyrus did not appear to learn her lesson as the singer opted for multiple shirtless looks at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night just months after she risked a wardrobe malfunction in a similar outfit on "Saturday Night Live." First, the recently married star walked the red carpet with her parents, Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus, in a black suit without a top. Cyrus' Grammys look echoed the outfit she wore during her December "SNL" performance with Mark Ronson which made headlines. The former "Hannah Montana" star was topless on the NBC show, save for a silver jacket that she wore open — and that miraculously stayed in place, accompanied by matching pants and boots. Despite Cyrus previously being totally naked in her "Wrecking Ball" music video and showing a ton more skin when she hosted the MTV Video Music Awards in 2015, Twitter still went into a tizzy at the time with fans remarking on her seemingly physics-defying outfit.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/i-can-t-find-any-peace-here-raised-u-s-n964341'>Raised in the U.S. and deported to Cambodia, refugees struggle to build a new life</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ikea-apologizes-leaving-new-zealand-world-map-n969941'>Ikea apologizes for leaving New Zealand off a world map</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hungary-axes-income-tax-women-4-or-more-kids-n969936'>Moms with 4 kids will pay no income tax as Hungary hopes for baby boom</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/search-party-moderate-dems-seek-one-their-own-win-2020-n969146'>Search party: Moderate Dems seek one of their own to win 2020 primary, topple Trump</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-claims-wall-made-el-paso-safe-data-n969506'>Fact check: Trump claims a wall made El Paso safe.
