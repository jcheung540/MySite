The governor of the northern state of Coahuila described the migrants as "asylum seekers," suggesting all had express intentions of surrendering to U.S. authorities. ... Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, speaking to "Fox News Sunday," charged that the compromise spending bill recently signed by President Trump to avert another partial government shutdown was little more than a disguised effort by some Republicans to torpedo his 2020 presidential candidacy. "Both parties have people that are still trying to get rid of Donald Trump," Limbaugh said, asserting that Democrats are also working to guarantee a "permanent underclass of voters" who are "uneducated" and "don't even speak" English.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/graham-calls-mccabe-comments-beyond-stunning-as-he-threatens-to-subpoena-former-fbi-chief'>Graham: McCabe, Rosenstein to be hauled before Senate over Trump talk</a></h3><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vowed Sunday to investigate alleged discussions at the Department of Justice about invoking the 25th Amendment as a way to oust President Trump from office and threatened to subpoena former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if he refused to testify on the matter before the Senate. "We're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning," Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on CBS’ "Face the Nation." Graham added that he also plans to subpoena both McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if they won’t voluntarily agree to testify before the committee. "There is no organization beyond scrutiny," Graham said. "There is no organization that can't withstand scrutiny.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-citys-de-blasio-blames-amazon-for-caving-on-deal-for-new-headquarters-in-city'>Liberal mayor: Tech giant caved, backed out of NYC after criticism</a></h3><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio laid the blame on Amazon deciding to pull up stakes on a new headquarters in the city squarely on the corporate behemoth, saying that the company just “took their ball and went home.” Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” de Blasio defended progressive Democrats who argued against Amazon’s move to the country’s largest city, but did add that the deal could have been a way for progressive leaders to show a balance on economic issues. “I have no problem with my fellow progressives critiquing a deal or wanting more from Amazon — I wanted more from Amazon, too,” de Blasio said. “The bottom line is, this was an example of an abuse of corporate power. They had an agreement with the people of New York City." He added: "They said they wanted a partnership, but the minute there were criticisms, they walked away.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/cancun-club-shooting-leaves-5-dead-5-wounded-authorities-say'>Gunfire at club in Mexico vacation hub kills 5</a></h3><p>At least five people were killed and another five were wounded Saturday after four gunmen opened fire inside a club in Cancun, Mexico, authorities said. The men, armed with a long gun and three handguns, opened fire inside La Kuka, a club located on a main avenue in central Cancun about 4 miles away from the seaside tourist hotel zone, Quintana Roo state prosecutors said. Two of the five wounded in the shooting remain in critical condition on Sunday. Cancun and Quintaroo have seen an uptick in violence, with federal authorities reporting 774 people killed in the state last year, compared to the recorded 359 killings in 2017. The violence may be due to reports of the Jalisco New Generation cartel moving into the Caribbean resort city and fighting other local gangs to gain control of the area.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/aw-restaurant-customers-continue-to-line-up-as-whole-roof-was-on-fire'>Customers line up for food in drive-thru despite flames</a></h3><p>An A&W restaurant caught fire last week – but that did not seem to deter its hungry customers, who continued to line up in the drive-thru while firefighters tried to put out the flames. Smoke reportedly began billowing out of the roof of the restaurant around 5 p.m. last Sunday in Winnipeg, Canada. Within minutes, crews were reportedly on the scene, where they remained battling the blaze until 2:30 a.m. However, some oblivious customers continued to try and use the drive-thru, which was closed because of the fire. “The restaurant was closed and the whole roof was on fire so we evacuated to a safe distance and waited for the fire fighters to arrive,” said Stuart Brick, who was passing by the restaurant when he saw the flames, CTV reported.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mud-snipers-global-flashpoint-frontlines-ukraine-s-frozen-war-n972561'>What life is like on the frontlines of the war in Ukraine</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='http://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/02/17/lebron-james-on-colin-kaepernick-i-stand-with-kap-i-kneel-with-kap/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>LeBron James on supporting Colin Kaepernick: 'I stand with Kap.
