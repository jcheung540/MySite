Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Wednesday was once again forced to apologize for claiming Native American ancestry on a 1986 registration card for the Texas state bar, and left the door open that there may be more documents out there with a similar claim. The controversy appears to be difficult for the senator to put behind her. She had been planning to formally launch her presidential campaign on Saturday. A reporter on Wednesday asked if she would drop out of the race and she responded, "Thank you." KAYLEIGH McENANY SAYS INSTAGRAM REMOVED HER WARREN POST Fox News' Shepard Smith called Warren's actions "cultural appropriation."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mr-president-the-system-is-broken-and-we-need-your-help-to-fix-it'>SEAN GALLAGHER: Mr. President, save my hero brother from broken system</a></h3><p>All the process. When Roger Stone’s house was raided by the FBI, it sparked conversation and serious questions about the justification of force, the presumption of innocence and the power of the government to bring its endless resources to bear on a private individual. While many were questioning the aggression and overreach of a government agency towards an American citizen, I wasn’t the least bit surprised. Why? Because it’s happening to my family right now – and to a much greater extent.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/photo-of-joy-behar-dressed-as-beautiful-african-woman'>Photo of Joy Behar dressed as 'beautiful African woman' resurfaces</a></h3><p>A long forgotten video clip from ABC's "The View" resurfaced on Wednesday that showed co-host Joy Behar trying to explain a Halloween costume from when she was younger. The clip was shared by The Wrap media editor Jon Levine. Behar was seen discussing a New York Times op-ed about the resurgence of curly hair during the show in 2016. Behar showed her colleagues and the audience a picture of herself with curly hair when she was 29 years old. The co-hosts appeared surprised by her drastically different look.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cindy-mccain-apologizes-after-police-refutes-her-story-of-stopping-human-trafficking-at-airport'>Cops shoot down Cindy McCain's claim she saved child from trafficking</a></h3><p>Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, apologized Wednesday after Phoenix police disputed her claim that she stopped a human trafficking attempt at an airport. “I commend the police officers for their diligence. I apologize if anything else I have said on this matter distracts from ‘if you see something, say something,’” McCain wrote on Twitter. Her apology came after city’s authorities refuted McCain’s claim on Monday that she saw a child being trafficked at the Sky Harbor International Airport last week. “I came in from a trip I’d been on and I spotted — it looked odd — it was a woman of a different ethnicity than the child, this little toddler she had, and something didn’t click with me,” McCain told KTAR News 92.3 FM.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bikini-baristas-appeal-city-ordinance-issuing-dress-code-debate-definition-of-anal-cleft'>Skin-baring baristas take suit against city to federal court</a></h3><p>How much “anal cleft” is one allow to show while at work? That’s the question one Washington court is trying to answer. A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an ongoing legal saga between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the anatomical phrase “anal cleft” and whether dress codes imposed on businesses violate their civil rights. Both sides appeared in court Monday to further argue the city’s ordinance, which was passed August 2017, that restricts what employees of “quick-service” restaurants wear by requiring that the “bottom one-half of the anal cleft” be covered, Herald Net reported.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/religion/ungodly-abuse-lasting-torment-new-tribes-missionary-kids-n967191'>Ungodly abuse: The lasting torment of the New Tribes missionary kids</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russian-agent-maria-butina-s-boyfriend-paul-erickson-accused-fraud-n968696'>Russian agent Maria Butina's boyfriend accused of fraud</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/jc-penney-will-no-longer-sell-major-appliances-or-furniture-n968691'>JC Penney will no longer sell major appliances or furniture in its stores</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/reporter-alleges-jill-abramson-lifted-material-her-book-merchants-truth-n968686'>Reporter alleges ex-NY Times editor lifted material for her book</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-predicts-all-islamic-state-territory-will-fall-within-days-n968676'>Final sliver of ISIS territory will fall within days, Trump predicts</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/02/06/report-mavericks-trading-harrison-barnes-to-kings/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Report: Dallas Mavericks trading Harrison Barnes to Sacramento Kings</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2019/02/06/body-recovered-from-wreckage-of-flight-carrying-sala/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text'>Body recovered from wreckage of flight carrying soccer player Emiliano Sala</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/two-men-arrested-trying-smuggle-drugs-gay-cruise-ship-police-n968591'>Two men arrested on drug charges while boarding Atlantis gay cruise</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/paul-erickson-indicted-russia-maria-butina/index.html'>Political operative who was dating alleged Russian spy is indicted</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/06/hirono-trump-congress-threatening-people-dealmaking-sot-tsr-vpx.cnn'>Senator: Trump is threatening Congress</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/dont-underestimate-joe-biden/index.html'>Analysis: Why we shouldn't underestimate Joe Biden</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/virginia-politics-chaos-governor-lieutenant-attorney-general/index.html'>Sadness, disbelief and disgust: Virginia plunges deeper into chaos as Dems worry</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown/index.html'>The government shutdown ended after only 10 air traffic controllers stayed home</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/opinions/sotu-foreign-policy-opinion-vinograd-kirby/index.html'>Opinion: Trump needs to think before he speaks</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/07/pelosi-clap-trump-state-of-the-union-moos-pkg-ebof-vpx.cnn'>Pelosi's clapback steals Trump's show</a></h3></div></body>
