As President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un square off in their high-stakes negotiations in Hanoi this week, Kim has an important advantage: an enormous amount of information is publicly available about Trump and his positions on key issues. The U.S. president draws intense media coverage, tweets frequently and speaks often to reporters. And – as happens during the administration of every American president – our free press reports on many developments that the U.S. government would no doubt prefer to keep quiet. Simply reading and watching U.S. media reports gives the North Koreans great insights into our president and U.S. policies.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ninth-circuit-gets-another-trump-picked-judge-after-white-house-bypasses-consultation-with-dems'>Liberal 9th Circuit gets new Trump-picked judge after WH bypasses Dems</a></h3><p>The Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Trump's nominee to be a judge on the liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a party-line vote -- and, in a historic snub, the White House ignored the input of the judge's two Democratic home-state senators in the process. The aggressive and unprecedented move to bypass the traditional "blue slip" consultation process and plow ahead with the confirmation comes as the Trump administration seeks to systematically erode left-wing dominance on the key appellate court, which Trump has called "disgraceful" and politically biased. With a sprawling purview representing nine Western states, the appellate court has long been a thorn in the side of the Trump White House, with rulings against his travel ban policy and limits on funding to "sanctuary cities." A lawsuit is currently pending before the 9th Circuit concerning Trump's emergency declaration over border security -- and Trump had sarcastically predicted that Democrats would purposefully file suit in the San Francisco-based appellate court to improve their odds.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cohen-to-accuse-trump-of-knowledge-in-wikileaks-leak-plot-call-him-a-racist-conman'>Cohen to deny direct evidence linking Trump campaign to Russia collusion</a></h3><p>In his testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, Michael Cohen will accuse his former client, President Trump, of knowing that his adviser Roger Stone was reaching out to WikiLeaks concerning the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails. But Cohen apparently will not claim Trump directed those communications, and Cohen will specifically assert that he lacks direct evidence of improper collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia -- a significant admission, given Cohen's longtime status as the president's former top lawyer and fixer. "Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia," Cohen will testify. "I do not. I want to be clear.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-fire-department-shows-what-happens-to-cars-parked-in-front-of-hydrants'>PICS: California fire department schools drivers who park next to hydrants</a></h3><p>Fire officials in California reminded drivers on Tuesday that vehicles parked front of a fire hydrant during an emergency are likely to feel a permanent breeze. The Anaheim Fire & Rescue Department had responded to a residential fire when they found a vehicle parked too close to a hydrant. The department later tweeted photos of a hose running through the smashed-out back passenger windows of the car, which was parked along a curb painted a stark red. “Ever wonder what happens when a car is parked in front of a fire hydrant and a fire breaks out?” the tweet reads. “Is a closer parking spot worth the broken windows and the citation and towing fees to @AnaheimPD?” The Anaheim police department, who also responded to the fire, tweeted that they had to run the hose line through the vehicle’s rear windows in order to battle the blaze.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-boots-heckler-who-joked-about-mac-millers-death-report'>Pete Davidson confronts heckler at live show, threatens to walk off stage</a></h3><p>Pete Davidson had zero tolerance for a heckler who reportedly made light of rapper Mac Miller’s death. According to Page Six, the “Saturday Night Live” funnyman was performing at the South Orange Performing Arts Center in New Jersey on Monday night when he began the set up for a joke by saying, “So a funny thing happened to me recently in my apartment … my friend died of a heart attack.” The outlet reported Tuesday that before Davidson, 25, could get to the punchline, the unruly showgoer shouted out, “Mac Miller!” Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in September at 26. The “Swimming” rapper dated Davidson’s ex-fiance, Ariana Grande, before Davidson did. The remark didn’t go over well with Davidson; the comedian is said to have stopped his set mid-joke in order to locate the jeerer. “Pete calmly stops his routine and asks the audience to ID the dude that yelled out and that he is going to have to leave,” an onlooker told the outlet.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kelsey-berreth-case-colorado-police-search-landfill-missing-woman-s-n976586'>Colorado police search landfill for missing woman's remains</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cairo-train-station-fire-kills-least-20-injures-dozens-n976581'>Train station fire kills at least 20, injures dozens in Cairo</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/spacex-readies-crew-dragon-spacecraft-first-test-flight-space-station-ncna976386'>SpaceX readies Crew Dragon spacecraft for first test flight to the space station</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-s-rouhani-rejects-resignation-foreign-minister-zarif-n976571'>Iran's president rejects foreign minister's resignation</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-man-sentenced-more-15-years-trying-help-terrorists-n976531'>Calif. man sentenced to more than 15 years for trying to help terrorists</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nigeria-s-president-declared-winner-second-term-after-bumpy-vote-n976556'>Nigeria's president wins second term</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/evacuations-ordered-waters-rise-storm-pummeled-northern-california-n976536'>Evacuations ordered as waters rise in storm-pummeled California</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/telemundo-journalist-abducted-questioned-venezuela-covering-detainment-univision-crew-n976521'>Journalist abducted and questioned for hours in Venezuela, network says</a></h3><br><h1><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/india/india-pakistan-strikes-escalation-intl/index.html'>Pakistan shot down two Indian jets, government claims, as border crisis escalates</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/africa/cairo-train-station-fire-intl/index.html'>Breaking 20 killed in train station fire in Cairo</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/aoc-ivanka-trump-minimum-wage/index.html'>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Ivanka Trump on Twitter</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/26/ivanka-trump-american-workers-green-new-deal-sot-lead-vpx.cnn'>Panelist: Ivanka Trump has no clue what she's talking about</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/us/amtrak-moment-by-moment/index.html'>Journey that stranded 200 train passengers felt 'like a nightmare'</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/us/mother-daughter-charged-killings-pennsylvania/index.html'>A cramped apartment hid broken glass, overturned furniture and five bodies</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/us/ny-trains-car-collision/index.html'>3 people are dead after their car was hit by two NY trains going in opposite directions </a></h3></div></body>
