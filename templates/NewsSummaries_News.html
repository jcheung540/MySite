But I instinctively feel that a good outcome will be produced." Talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wrapped up significantly earlier than expected on Thursday, and the White House announced that no agreement had been reached between the leaders. A planned signing ceremony set for Thursday afternoon in Hanoi, Vietnam, was scrubbed, and Trump was set to take the stage within minutes for a solo press conference. "No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-mischaracterized-sf-policy-on-undocumented-minors-cnn-says'>Harris 'mischaracterized' past SF policy on undocumented minors: report</a></h3><p>U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris “mischaracterized” a 2008 San Francisco policy regarding undocumented minors when she participated in a CNN podcast earlier this week, the network asserted Wednesday. Harris -- a California Democrat who is seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination -- made the comments while speaking to an audience in Iowa on Sunday on “Political Party Live,” the network reported. According to CNN, host Misty Rebik asked Harris about a past report by the network that claimed Harris backed a San Francisco policy of reporting arrests of undocumented juveniles to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Harris responded by saying the notification of ICE was an “unintended consequence” of the city policy, enacted by then-Mayor Gavin Newsom. (Newsom is now governor of California, while Harris is a U.S. senator after being the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and then attorney general of California from 2011-2017.)</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/actress-ellen-page-talks-jussie-smollett-controversy-i-had-no-reason-to-doubt-him'>Actress who lashed out at GOP after Smollett claims reacts to alleged hoax</a></h3><p>Actress Ellen Page reacted to the Jussie Smollett controversy weeks after bashing the White House and Vice President Pence, saying she had “no reason to doubt” the "Empire" star was the victim of a hate crime after he made his claims. In a guest column featured in The Hollywood Reporter, Page said that the dispute over whether Smollett staged his own attack shouldn’t distract people from the “very real” violence that the LGBTQ community faces. “While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” her column read. “The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie.” Weeks earlier, Page, who identifies as gay, used her appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” to criticize Pence in the wake of Smollett's claims.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/husband-of-michigan-tv-meteorologist-who-committed-suicide-breaks-silence'>Husband of Michigan TV meteorologist who committed suicide breaks silence</a></h3><p>Meteorologist Jessica Starr reportedly didn’t suffer from depression or take antidepressants before undergoing eye surgery and ultimately committing suicide late last year, her husband has claimed. "Prior to the procedure, Jessica was completely normal, very healthy. There was no depression, there was no antidepressants, there was no underlying issue," her husband Dan Rose recently told Fox 2 Detroit, the TV station where she used to work. "I want to make that absolutely clear. Jessica was incredibly normal - there wasn't a long battle with depression.” Word of Starr’s death in December was announced on air by Fox 2 Detroit, where she had worked since 2012.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/travel/emotional-support-animal-mauls-5-year-old-at-portland-airport-lawsuit-claims'>'Emotional support animal' mauls 5-year-old girl at airport, lawsuit claims</a></h3><p>WARNING: Graphic image below A mom has filed a $1.1 million lawsuit against the owner of a pit bull and Alaska Airlines after the animal allegedly mauled her 5-year-old’s face at the Portland International Airport. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Multnomah County by Mirna Gonzalez on behalf of her daughter, Gabriela Gonzalez, claims Michelle Brannan, the dog’s owner, should have known her animal had “vicious propensities” and that Alaska Airlines allowed her to bring a dangerous dog into the gate waiting area without being confined or trained. According to the suit, the incident took place Dec. 18, 2017, while Gabriella Gonzalez was waiting at Gate C7 with her family for a flight to Texas at the Portland hub. Gabriella, then aged 5, was waiting at the gate when Brannan entered the area with her pit bull, which was not kept in a crate, kennel or other secure container, the lawsuit claims. The child allegedly gained permission from Brannan to pet the dog.</p><br><br><h1 id=MSNBC><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctor-shot-patient-wheelchair-florida-va-hospital-fbi-says-n977506'>Doctor shot by patient in wheelchair in VA hospital, FBI says</a></h3><p>A doctor at a Florida hospital for veterans was shot by a patient, a double amputee in a wheelchair, as the patient was taken to the emergency room Wednesday evening, officials said. Larry Ray Bon, 59, of Michigan, opened fire with a handgun about 6:20 p.m. at West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, Justin Fleck, assistant special agent in charge at the Miami FBI Office, said at a news conference Wednesday night.

Four crew members were hospitalized, and another six were examined after the 7:17 p.m. landing, the airline said in a statement.

President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un abruptly broke off a nuclear summit here Thursday, canceling a planned signing ceremony for a pact. "No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Sanders called the meetings "good and constructive" and noted that Trump and Kim "discussed various ways to advance denuclearization and economic driven concepts.

The sometimes raucous hearing, held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, laid out one of the main challenges: stopping the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation about the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine that have contributed to vaccine-hesitancy in many communities. At least twice, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., stopped the hearing when audience members, both for and against immunization, shouted down speakers over vaccine safety. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, acknowledged that there hasn’t been effective countering of the anti-vaccine movement. “Misinformation is an important problem,” Fauci said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-n-j-superintendent-who-defecated-public-says-police-shouldn-n976996'>Superintendent who defecated in public says police shouldn't have released mugshot</a></h3><p>A former school superintendent who was charged with defecating on a high school’s track has asked New Jersey’s attorney general to investigate whether police acted unlawfully when they took his mugshot and released it to the media. The Holmdel Township Police Department's "actions were the height of willful misconduct, professional irresponsibility and a total disdain for the law,” attorney Matthew Adams said Monday in a letter to Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. Thomas Tramaglini was charged with lewdness, littering and defecating in public in May after police said he repeatedly defecated on the Holmdel High School track. Tramaglini pleaded guilty in October to relieving himself in public once in the midst of a medical emergency and paid a $500 fine.

The legal action means three government agencies are known to be scrutinizing the finances of the inaugural committee after it raised and spent a record $107 million. The revelation of the new investigation, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes three weeks after the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York subpoenaed the committee. New Jersey's attorney general is also probing how it spent the massive haul of cash. An inaugural committee spokesperson released a brief statement acknowledging that it had received the subpoena from the office of D.C.

U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled Wednesday that the state “created this mess” and ordered officials in the 18 counties named as defendants not to remove anyone from the voter registration rolls without his approval. “As Robert Fulghum taught in ‘All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,’ always put things back where we found them and clean up our own messes,” the judge said in his order. He also ordered acting Texas Secretary of State David Whitley to advise officials in the rest of the 254 counties to also not remove anyone from the lists without the court’s approval.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apply-lay-190-employees-self-driving-car-division-n977386'>Apple to lay off 190 employees from self-driving car division</a></h3><p>Apple is set to terminate 190 jobs in its self-driving car division later this spring, according to a letter issued earlier this month to the California Employment Development Department. The news of the layoffs was broken last month by CNBC, but the formal notice was first reported Wednesday by the San Francisco Chronicle. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr confirmed the announcement to NBC News. The affected jobs — most of which are engineering positions — are in Apple facilities in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, near the company’s main headquarters in Cupertino. The terminations are effective as of April 16.</p><br><br><h1 id=CNN><a href='https://www.cnn.com/'>CNN</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/cohen-testimony-trump-legal-troubles-southern-district-new-york/index.html'>Cohen's testimony escalates Trump's legal troubles in New York</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-lessons/index.html'>Analysis: 8 things we learned from Cohen today</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/28/michael-cohen-testifies-mh-orig.cnn'>Theatrics aside, here are the moments that matter</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/27/michael-cohen-testimony-closing-remarks-message-trump-supporters-sot-vpx.cnn'>Cohen's closing: I fear Trump won't leave peacefully</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/opinions/trumps-base-wont-desert-him-over-cohen-but-thats-not-the-key-zelizer/index.html'>Opinion: Trump's base won't defect, but that's not the key thing</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/gallery/michael-cohen-testimony/index.html'>In pictures: Cohen on Capitol Hill</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/27/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-michael-cohen-testimony-vpx.cnn'>See Ocasio-Cortez's exchange with Michael Cohen</a></h3></div></body>
