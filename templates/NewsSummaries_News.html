Even as conservatives sound the alarm about potential Second Amendment violations, supporters -- sometimes across party lines -- say these "red flag" laws are among the most promising tools to reduce the nearly 40,000 suicides and homicides by firearm each year in the country. “I think we’re seeing a building consensus in blue states and red states that this is a good way to balance public safety against people’s Second Amendment rights,” Jaron Lindbaum, a representative of the activist grop Washington Ceasefire, told Fox News. Nine states have passed laws over the past year allowing police or household members to seek court orders requiring people deemed threatening to temporarily surrender their guns, bringing the total to 14.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kimberley-strassel-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-the-secret-republican-weapon-for-2020'>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: A show-stealing Dem is the GOP's secret weapon in 2020</a></h3><p>. The Republican Party has a secret weapon for 2020. It’s especially effective because it’s stealthy: The Democrats seem oblivious to its power. And the GOP needn’t lift a finger for it to work. All Republicans have to do is sit back and watch 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rob-lowe-deletes-elizabeth-warren-chief-joke-after-hollywood-backlash'>Actor deletes joke about Dem 2020 hopeful after social media backlash</a></h3><p>Actor Rob Lowe removed a Twitter post that poked fun at U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Saturday out of concern that “some peeps got upset.” Earlier in the day, Lowe responded on the social media platform after the Massachusetts Democrat officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign with a kickoff event in Lawrence, Mass. “Elizabeth Warren would bring a whole new meaning to Commander in ‘Chief,’” Lowe wrote in the now-deleted post, in an apparent reference to the controversy over Warren’s claims of Native American heritage. But many social media users – including fellow Hollywood actors -- were not amused. “What a raw blow!” “Star Wars” star Mark Hamill wrote. “That’s not funny,” actor Vincent D’Onofrio added.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/asos-confuses-internet-with-horrific-trend'>Bizarre new 'crotchless pants' slammed by confused shoppers</a></h3><p>When it comes to following fast fashion trends, we like to follow the age-old saying "sometimes less is more". But now ASOS has turned the fashion rulebook on its head with its new bonkers bum-flashing leg harness — which really makes us wish there was more to it. Something of a underwear/cycling short hybrid, this baffling item features a somewhat flattering high-waisted cut. But what we really can't wrap our heads around — from both a practical and fashion standpoint — is the bizarre cut outs over the bum, crotch and thighs. And while ASOS usually provides helpful hints on how to style their products in the description, the brand simply chose to write: "It's already got your attention..." That's one thing they've got right.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/13-shirley-temple-facts-you-should-know-in-honor-of-the-late-child-star'>Iconic child star's racy start in Hollywood, and other little-known facts</a></h3><p>Hollywood became dimmer on Feb. 10, 2014 when Shirley Temple, the dimpled, curly-haired child star who brought joy to Americans during the Depression died at age 85. As a tot, Temple was the country’s top box office draw from 1935 until 1938, and beat out Clark Gable, Bing Crosby and Joan Crawford — just to name a few. In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Temple as No. 18 among their top 25 actresses and she is credited with helping save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy with films such as 1935's “Curly Top” and “The Littlest Rebel.” And even though Temple retired from films at age 21, she later became active in politics and held several diplomatic posts in Republican administrations. In 1972, she raised awareness of breast cancer after having successful surgery to combat the disease.</p><br><br><h1><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/'>MSNBC</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcsports.com/video/lindsey-vonn-final-career-run-most-nervous-ive-ever-been-my-life?cid=eref:nbcnews:video'>Lindsey Vonn on final career run: Most nervous I've ever been in my life</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/woman-followed-different-self-help-book-every-month-year-here-ncna969401'>Would you follow advice from a self-help book every month for a year?
