Results include double-digit improvement in functional status of the patients at the first follow-up visit, and a decrease of more than 25% in the utilization of elective surgical procedures among the population receiving care. Development of Bundled Payments Medicare pioneered bundled payments with the adoption of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system for hospital inpatient services in 1983. Since then, bundled payments have expanded and evolved from hospitals to incorporate other providers with the goal of improving patient outcomes and lowering costs, through financial incentives to coordinate care and eliminate inefficient services.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/nursing-bundle-consistent-patient-experience/'>Using a “Nursing Bundle” to Achieve Consistent Patient Experiences Across a Multi-Hospital System</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge. Geisinger Health System has evolved and grown in terms of diverse cultures, demography, and size over the past 4 years. We addressed inconsistent patient experience by creating a nursing bundle that helped make patients’ experiences more consistent, and more consistently excellent, improving overall patient satisfaction and Geisinger’s performance on standard assessments of patient satisfaction.

We are measuring our HCAHPS and nursing bundle scores on a monthly basis.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/need-more-geriatricians-primary-care/'>We Need More Geriatricians, Not More Primary Care Physicians</a></h3><p>Who will take care of the increasing number of aging, more medically complex and frail people? What our country needs now is more geriatricians. Geriatricians specialize in the care of older adults, whether working as consultants or as primary care physicians. Their role in primary care is increasingly important because our current primary care system is ill-equipped, and in some cases, unwilling, to provide care for older adults. Ironically, the patients who need primary care the most — those with multiple chronic illnesses, or those with dementia or other aging-related syndromes — are usually the ones who cannot find accessible primary care physicians in family medicine or general internal medicine.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/tiered-escalation-huddles-yield-rapid-results/'>Tiered Escalation Huddles Yield Rapid Results</a></h3><p>As leaders, we like to think we have all the information we need to address issues effectively and efficiently; but in reality, the information we have is often lagging, coming to us in post-problem, aggregated reports. The information that leaders really need is at the front lines and in real time; and, in just 15 minutes each day, leaders can communicate and align the organization to what is most important. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts on response times and critical action plans that resolve safety, practice, access, and stewardship issues. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts.” That communication channel can also build a culture of respect and value within an organization and bridge the age-old “does management care?” gap by showing caregivers that leadership is listening to them and addressing issues proactively.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/innovation-dialysis-continuous-improvement/'>Innovation in Dialysis: Continuous Improvement and Implementation</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge.

Implementation science (i.e., the science of applying research findings and evidence-based interventions to routine clinical practice) is less frequently recognized as a form of innovation. However, it plays a key role in evolving care by translating new techniques, protocols, and clinical insights into the field. While much has been written about the theory of implementation science, very few scientific articles have detailed its best practices in health care.</p><br><br><h1 id=MHealthcare><a href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/'>Modern Healthcare</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/likely-return-health-insurance-tax-impact-ma-profits'>
Likely return of the health insurance tax to impact MA profits
</a></h3><p>Congress appears unlikely to delay the health insurance tax next year. If that happens, Medicare Advantage plans would see the biggest impact, analysts and insurers say. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a suspension of the tax, known as the HIT, through 2021. The tax was in place for 2018, suspended in 2019 and is due to take effect again in 2020. But as House lawmakers unrolled their proposal for another delay, senior congressional staff from both chambers and parties said they don't think it's likely to move before insurers start setting their ACA exchange rates next year.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/government/insurer-hospital-lobbyists-unite-against-medicare-all-proposals'>
Insurer, hospital lobbyists unite against Medicare for All proposals
</a></h3><p>NASHVILLE—The audience of healthcare executives had expected the heads of the influential insurance and hospital lobbying groups to butt heads. But Matt Eyles, CEO of lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans, and his counterpart Chip Kahn of the Federation for American Hospitals were on the same page Wednesday while discussing potential threats to their industries and who they consider the culprit in the nation's healthcare costs conundrum. They were so congenial that audience members at the Nashville Health Care Council discussion prodded the moderator to find some topic they could spar over. But there were few points of contention. Eyles and Kahn were united in their opposition to the Medicare For All proposals, which they agreed are largely symbolic but something to be taken seriously.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/blues-association-hopes-convince-congress-stabilize-aca-exchanges'>
Blues association hopes to convince Congress to stabilize ACA exchanges
</a></h3><p>The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association wants to resurrect congressional efforts to stabilize the Affordable Care Act's exchanges by boosting tax subsidies and cost-sharing payments. The association, which represents more than 30 Blues plans across the U.S., released a legislative proposal on Thursday to boost subsidies for ACA exchange customers to entice younger people to sign up on the exchanges and help customers that earn too much to get a subsidy. The proposal would also install a reinsurance program, resume reimbursements to insurers of cost-sharing reduction payments and further delay the ACA's health insurance tax. The proposal is geared towards "making coverage more affordable for those who have not had any assistance," said Justine Handelman, the association's senior vice president in the Office of Policy and Representation, during a briefing with reporters Thursday.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/ethics/times-up-launches-healthcare-branch-address-harassment'>

</a></h3><p>A healthcare offshoot of Time's Up will officially launch on March 1 to try to bring safety and equity to the workplace. Time's Up was spawned out of the #MeToo movement, which gained global attention in 2017 as scores of women shared their stories of sexual harassment on social media. Time's Up has since spread to multiple industries as it looks to spur change. Time's Up Healthcare's goals include uniting healthcare workers against harassment and inequity and advancing research, improving care for those who have been marginalized, supporting awareness within healthcare organizations, promoting higher workplace standards regarding inclusivity and diversity, reaching equitable compensation levels and linking healthcare workers to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. The defense fund has raised $24 million, according its website.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/cleveland-clinic-outlines-ambitious-goals-serving-more-patients'>

</a></h3><p>Cleveland Clinic, already a behemoth in healthcare, wants to double the number of patients it treats in just five years, clinic president and CEO Dr. Tom Mihaljevic announced Wednesday morning, Feb. 27, in the State of the Clinic address. In the annual speech, he highlighted the system's finances, which took a hit in 2018, as well as the health of the institution's care of its patients, its caregivers, its community and itself. Mihaljevic wants the clinic to see more than 4 million patients annually by 2024. Digital health will be a major driver in reaching that goal, as well as population health and the opening of Cleveland Clinic London in 2021. Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi also is growing at roughly 30% every year.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/people/chuck-stokes-retire-president-and-ceo-memorial-hermann'>

The system's operating margin was 2.4% in its fiscal 2016, down from 3.2% in fiscal 2015. When factoring in income tax and interest expense, UPMC's 2018 operating margin shrunk to 0%, down from 0.6% in the prior year.

Senate bill wants to sweeten deal for states to expand Medicaid
</a></h3><p>A trio of Democratic senators introduced a bill on Wednesday that would give states that recently expanded Medicaid the same federal funding as those that previously expanded. The legislation from Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama comes as more red states are considering expansion. "It's crazy that for so many years, Virginia taxpayers were footing the bill for states that had already expanded Medicaid," Warner said in a statement. So far 33 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid since the expansion was implemented in 2014 and three other states (Idaho, Utah and Nebraska) that passed a ballot measure to expand it.</p><br><br><h1 id=Politico><a href='https://www.politico.com/health-care'>Politico</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/28/medicare-for-all-democrats-1229517'>Establishment Dems give Medicare-for-All the brush off</a></h3><p> By Nahal Toosi By Jack Shafer By POLITICO Staff Rep.
