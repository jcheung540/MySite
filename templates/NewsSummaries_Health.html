Results include double-digit improvement in functional status of the patients at the first follow-up visit, and a decrease of more than 25% in the utilization of elective surgical procedures among the population receiving care. Development of Bundled Payments Medicare pioneered bundled payments with the adoption of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system for hospital inpatient services in 1983. Since then, bundled payments have expanded and evolved from hospitals to incorporate other providers with the goal of improving patient outcomes and lowering costs, through financial incentives to coordinate care and eliminate inefficient services.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/nursing-bundle-consistent-patient-experience/'>NEJM Catalyst: Using a “Nursing Bundle” to Achieve Consistent Patient Experiences Across a Multi-Hospital System</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge.

What our country needs now is more geriatricians. Geriatricians specialize in the care of older adults, whether working as consultants or as primary care physicians. Their role in primary care is increasingly important because our current primary care system is ill-equipped, and in some cases, unwilling, to provide care for older adults. Ironically, the patients who need primary care the most — those with multiple chronic illnesses, or those with dementia or other aging-related syndromes — are usually the ones who cannot find accessible primary care physicians in family medicine or general internal medicine.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/tiered-escalation-huddles-yield-rapid-results/'>NEJM Catalyst: Tiered Escalation Huddles Yield Rapid Results</a></h3><p>As leaders, we like to think we have all the information we need to address issues effectively and efficiently; but in reality, the information we have is often lagging, coming to us in post-problem, aggregated reports. The information that leaders really need is at the front lines and in real time; and, in just 15 minutes each day, leaders can communicate and align the organization to what is most important. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts on response times and critical action plans that resolve safety, practice, access, and stewardship issues. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts.” That communication channel can also build a culture of respect and value within an organization and bridge the age-old “does management care?” gap by showing caregivers that leadership is listening to them and addressing issues proactively.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/using-health-care-data-change/'>NEJM Catalyst: Survey Snapshot: Using Data for Change</a></h3><p>From the Care Redesign Insights Report: How Data and Analytics Improve Clinical Care. Click To Enlarge. A decade ago, New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH) changed its top leadership with a new CEO and tightened its focus by winnowing to an orthopedics-only specialty hospital. Now, to keep the hospital on track and high performing, NEBH is counting on analysis of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and other critical health care data to guide clinical leadership, says Scott Tromanhauser, MD, MBA, MHCDS, Chief Medical Officer and Chief of Spine Surgery. What if we could predict who would have a bad outcome, based on past PROs, and offer them a nonoperative approach?” “We are just starting to see the fruits of our labor,” Tromanhauser says of one recent analytics effort, started a year ago, to gather long-term patient feedback around total hip replacements, total knee replacements, and spine surgeries to gauge outcomes and patient experience.</p><br><br><h1 id=MHealthcare><a href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/'>Modern Healthcare</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/safety-quality/hospitals-hopeful-big-changes-are-coming-cms-star-ratings'>Modern Healthcare: 
Hospitals hopeful big changes are coming to the CMS’ star ratings
</a></h3><p>Hospitals have for years been advocating for overhauling the CMS’ star-rating program. They may finally get their wish. The agency is seeking public input on a comprehensive list of potential changes to the program, including tossing out the long-standing model used to assign ratings. In the 48-page document, the CMS acknowledged virtually all of the most common complaints pitted against the star ratings since they were first released to the public in July 2016. Perhaps the most surprising is the thought of replacing the latent variable model with another approach.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/azar-kidney-dialysis-needs-move-patient-homes'>Modern Healthcare: 
Azar: kidney dialysis needs to move to patient homes
</a></h3><p>HHS Secretary Alex Azar on Monday told a crowd of kidney disease patients and advocates the Trump administration is overhauling Medicare's payment system to move the bulk of dialysis treatments from clinics to the home. He touted an existing payment demonstration launched by the CMS Innovation Center under the Obama administration in 2015, which has the backing of the dialysis industry: the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Seamless Care Organizations. Medicare has an outsize influence on kidney care policy. Kidney disease accounted for more than one-fifth of all Medicare spending in 2016, or about $113 billion, and the program covers people under 65 who suffer from end-stage renal disease that can only be treated with dialysis or a transplant. "Today, 88% of Americans with end-stage renal disease start treatment with center-based dialysis," Azar told the National Kidney Foundation audience.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/law-regulation/stark-law-changes-open-up-value-based-model-participation-verma-says'>Modern Healthcare:

</a></h3><p>CMS Administrator Seema Verma gave her first update on a major overhaul to the Stark law, saying that a key part of the regulation will remove a barrier to doctors participating in value-based arrangements. A major part of the agency's updates to the anti-kickback law is clarifying areas of noncompliance for doctors and updating the decades-old rules to reflect the shift from a fee-for-service model to value-based care, Verma said during the Federation of American Hospitals' policy conference in Washington Monday. "Some changes include clarifying regulatory definition of volume or value, commercial reasonableness and fair-market value," Verma said of the updated regulation likely to be released later this year. She added that the updated regulation will also address signatures, incorrect dates and other areas of "technical noncompliance."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/operations/beth-israel-deaconess-awarded-2m-amazon-ai-research-grant'>Modern Healthcare:

Amazon Web Services is sponsoring a multiyear research program at Beth Israel, under which researchers at the hospital will study how machine learning—a type of AI—can support patient care and clinical workflows. Beth Israel, a Harvard Medical School-affiliated teaching hospital that's part of the newly formed Beth Israel Lahey Health system, began migrating a "significant portion" of its data center to AWS in 2016.

Northwell shows savings in Medicare pilot testing house calls
</a></h3><p>It has been two years since Rose Katz, 83, came home after an extended stay at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. Back in December 2016, she was rushed to the emergency room after her heartbeat slowed and her body temperature dropped to 91 degrees. Her heart stopped twice while at the hospital, where physicians discovered a blockage and implanted a pacemaker. After more than a month at a rehab facility, Katz returned home on Valentine's Day 2017 and was enrolled in Northwell's House Calls program. The program is part of a Medicare experiment to see if healthcare providers can save money by bringing primary care into their sickest patients' homes.

Rising vaccine exemptions call physicians' role in outbreaks into question
</a></h3><p>California has one of the strictest requirements for childhood vaccinations in the U.S. after the state eliminated exemptions based on philosophical and religious grounds in 2015. Yet the state has seen a rise of unvaccinated children over the past couple years due to physicians granting medical exemptions from immunization. At least two children with medical exemptions contracted measles during an outbreak in the state last year, potentially exposing others to the highly contagious virus. That fuels fears that some clinicians are contributing to immunization coverage gaps by helping vaccine-hesitant parents bypass the state's vaccination requirements. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published findings Thursday on a measles outbreak in Santa Clara County between March 4 and April 3, 2018.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/technology/rush-data-breach-exposes-45000-patients'>Modern Healthcare:

</a></h3><p>Rush System for Health says personal information for about 45,000 patients has been compromised. The health system disclosed in a financial filing that the data breach, which it learned about on Jan. 22, was due to an employee at one of its third-party claims processing vendors sharing a file containing patient information with an unauthorized party. While medical history was not disclosed, patient names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdates and health insurance information for those tens of thousands of patients was exposed. Hospital spokeswoman Deb Song said today the firm involved is Lombard-based MiraMed, and the breach is considered low risk since no personal financial information was disclosed. She added that all patients involved have been offered 12 months of identify protection services for free.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/technology/cvs-health-appoints-cio-lead-aetna-integration'>Modern Healthcare:

Navagamuwa will lead technology operations and innovation, including client services for CVS Caremark. One of his primary responsibilities will involve overseeing integration of the company's IT systems with Aetna's, according to a CVS Health statement.

During the hearing the pair put a spotlight on the importance of high drug list prices. Questioning drug company CEOs last week, Sens. Charles Grassley and Ron Wyden hammered away at the importance of high list prices for prescription drugs, while the CEOs testifying before the Senate Finance Committee mostly tried to change the subject.

The company says it will introduce a version of the diabetes treatment called Insulin Lispro with a list price 50% lower than its current rate of about $275 per vial. The discounted insulin will sell for $137.35 per vial or $265.20 for a five pack of Kwik Pens. A company spokeswoman said the average person uses about two vials a month, and the pack of pens can last a month or more. The company said it is working to make the insulin available as quickly as possible.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/harvard-pilgrim-continues-financial-turnaround'>Modern Healthcare: 
Harvard Pilgrim continues financial turnaround 
</a></h3><p>Harvard Pilgrim Health Care continued its financial turnaround in 2018 after posting several consecutive years of operating losses. Massachusetts' second-largest health plan, with nearly 1.2 million enrollees in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, reported an operating income of $70.9 million on revenue of $3.2 billion in 2018, up from a $28.3 million operating loss on revenue of $3 billion. Wellesley, Mass.-based Harvard Pilgrim's financial struggles began in 2014 as it had difficulty adapting to the risk-adjustment program implemented through the Affordable Care Act, Michael Carson, president and CEO of Harvard Pilgrim, told Modern Healthcare. But the organization has started to manage that coding process better throughout the system, which has helped, he said. It also narrowed its service lines in 2018, implemented a medical cost-management process, restructured its pharmaceutical spending and reduced its administrative overhead.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/setting-bar-hospital-prices'>Modern Healthcare: 
Setting the bar for hospital prices
</a></h3><p>“You can’t cut the cost of anything if you don’t know the cost.” Dale Folwell North Carolina treasurer North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell, who oversees the health plan serving the state’s teachers, lawmakers and other workers, is facing a problem all too familiar among the nation’s employers. Employee healthcare costs are climbing at a rate the state can’t sustain, while workers’ premiums are eating up more and more of their paychecks. Spending on medical and pharmacy services for the nearly 730,000 employees and their families is increasing by about 7% each year. Meanwhile, the Legislature will provide only a 4% budget hike, putting the North Carolina State Health Plan on a path to run out of money in the next five years, according to the treasurer’s office. On top of that, the state health plan harbors an unfunded liability of $33 billion for retiree health benefits.</p><br><br><h1 id=Politico><a href='https://www.politico.com/health-care'>Politico</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/doctors-gun-control-debate-1231765'>Politico: Politically active doctors test limits of gun control debate</a></h3><p>House Democrats say their increasingly visible alliance with politically active physicians helped them pass legislation mandating federal background checks on all gun sales. But they so far haven’t broken through the wall of opposition in the GOP-majority Senate. Surgeons and other health workers with experience treating firearm wounds lobbied hard for the universal background check bill the House passed last week, adding a sober, public health perspective to a debate long stuck in partisan stalemate.

Critics are also concerned that the FDA’s unusual celebration of Apple’s new tech — which is central to the company’s move into health care — represents boosterism that distorts the agency’s role of assuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices. The concerns center on an algorithm accessible through the Apple Watch that detects atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can elevate some individuals’ risk of stroke. In many cases, the watch has given users warnings that led them to get necessary and even life-saving medical help. Stacey Recktenwald, a nurse, said her daughter’s kidney failure “really would’ve been missed” without an Apple Watch warning that her heart rate was elevated.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/03/measles-outbreak-vaccination-1192887'>Politico: State lawmakers pushing for laxer vaccine rules despite measles outbreaks</a></h3><p>Measles is spreading from New York to Texas to Washington state in the worst outbreak in years, but some state lawmakers want to take the vaccination debate in the opposite direction: Loosening rules covering whether kids get inoculated. In Oregon, state lawmakers will consider a so-called transparency bill favored by the "vaccine hesitant." New York is simultaneously considering eliminating and expanding exemptions that allow parents to opt out. One bill in Texas would prohibit the state from even tracking exemptions. The push to loosen the rules is occurring even as the U.S. has experienced more than 160 measles cases in 10 states since Jan. 1, including 74 in Washington state and Oregon linked to the outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, according to the states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/pharma-drug-prices-1220080'>Politico: Friction between drugmakers, GOP intensifies at hearing on pharma pricing</a></h3><p>The drug industry may no longer be able to take congressional Republicans' support for granted after the Senate Finance Committee grilled seven company executives on their pricing practices on Tuesday. The roughly four-hour Senate Finance Committee hearing didn't yield many fiery confrontations, and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassleyindicated he will go slow pursuing pricing legislation. But the companies took hits from Republican lawmakers like Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who accused AbbVie of abusing the patent system by obtaining 247 patents to protect its multibillion-dollar arthritis drug Humira from competition for more than 30 years. “Is it your company’s position that it should have an exclusive monopoly on that medication for 31 years?” Cornyn asked AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/house-democrats-medicare-for-all-1189139'>Politico: House Democrats to release 'Medicare for All' bill — without a price tag</a></h3><p>Progressive House Democrats will unveil their much-hyped “Medicare for All” legislation Wednesday, providing the most detailed blueprint yet for how they would upend the health care system to guarantee coverage for every American — a long-sought progressive dream that is already shaping the Democratic race to challenge President Donald Trump. The bill, co-sponsored by just over 100 House Democrats, doesn’t include a price tag or specific proposals for financing the new system, which analysts estimate would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade. The lead sponsor, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, said she will release a separate list of suggested funding mechanisms, including a tax on high earners or mandated employer contributions.
