Results include double-digit improvement in functional status of the patients at the first follow-up visit, and a decrease of more than 25% in the utilization of elective surgical procedures among the population receiving care. Development of Bundled Payments Medicare pioneered bundled payments with the adoption of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system for hospital inpatient services in 1983. Since then, bundled payments have expanded and evolved from hospitals to incorporate other providers with the goal of improving patient outcomes and lowering costs, through financial incentives to coordinate care and eliminate inefficient services.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/nursing-bundle-consistent-patient-experience/'>Using a “Nursing Bundle” to Achieve Consistent Patient Experiences Across a Multi-Hospital System</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge.

We addressed inconsistent patient experience by creating a nursing bundle that helped make patients’ experiences more consistent, and more consistently excellent, improving overall patient satisfaction and Geisinger’s performance on standard assessments of patient satisfaction.

We are measuring our HCAHPS and nursing bundle scores on a monthly basis.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/need-more-geriatricians-primary-care/'>We Need More Geriatricians, Not More Primary Care Physicians</a></h3><p>Who will take care of the increasing number of aging, more medically complex and frail people? What our country needs now is more geriatricians. Geriatricians specialize in the care of older adults, whether working as consultants or as primary care physicians. Their role in primary care is increasingly important because our current primary care system is ill-equipped, and in some cases, unwilling, to provide care for older adults. Ironically, the patients who need primary care the most — those with multiple chronic illnesses, or those with dementia or other aging-related syndromes — are usually the ones who cannot find accessible primary care physicians in family medicine or general internal medicine.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/tiered-escalation-huddles-yield-rapid-results/'>Tiered Escalation Huddles Yield Rapid Results</a></h3><p>As leaders, we like to think we have all the information we need to address issues effectively and efficiently; but in reality, the information we have is often lagging, coming to us in post-problem, aggregated reports. The information that leaders really need is at the front lines and in real time; and, in just 15 minutes each day, leaders can communicate and align the organization to what is most important. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts on response times and critical action plans that resolve safety, practice, access, and stewardship issues. A significant amount of any health system’s knowledge lives in the heads of its caregivers; providing them with a fast and convenient way to escalate that information to leadership can have lasting impacts.” That communication channel can also build a culture of respect and value within an organization and bridge the age-old “does management care?” gap by showing caregivers that leadership is listening to them and addressing issues proactively.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/innovation-dialysis-continuous-improvement/'>Innovation in Dialysis: Continuous Improvement and Implementation</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge.

Implementation science (i.e., the science of applying research findings and evidence-based interventions to routine clinical practice) is less frequently recognized as a form of innovation. However, it plays a key role in evolving care by translating new techniques, protocols, and clinical insights into the field. While much has been written about the theory of implementation science, very few scientific articles have detailed its best practices in health care.</p><br><br><h1 id=MHealthcare><a href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/'>Modern Healthcare</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/beth-israel-deaconess-and-lahey-health-complete-merger'>
Beth Israel Deaconess and Lahey Health complete merger
</a></h3><p>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Lahey Health officially combined to form Beth Israel Lahey Health, the second-largest health system in Massachusetts, the organizations announced Friday. In November, Massachusetts' attorney general approved the deal with conditions including a seven-year price cap; participation in MassHealth, the state's combined Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program; and $71.6 million in investments supporting healthcare services for low-income and underserved communities in Massachusetts. The price cap guarantees Beth Israel Lahey Health's price increases will remain below the state's annual healthcare cost growth benchmark of 3.1% for seven years. That will prevent more than $1 billion of the potential cost increases over a seven-year span projected by the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, according to Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/gao-va-kept-medical-staff-despite-misconduct-allegations'>
GAO: VA kept medical staff despite misconduct allegations
</a></h3><p>Veterans Affairs health centers hired and retained physicians, nurses and other clinicians despite their records of alleged misconduct. According to a government watchdog report, some of these clinicians had also lost state licenses to practice. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) in its 102-page report focused on clinicians who were part of the VA's medical staff as of Sept. 30, 2016. The agency took a random sampling of 57 of the 1,664 VA providers with a record in the National Practitioner Data Bank. This online repository lists disciplinary action taken by state licensing boards and professional societies against individual clinicians.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/opinion-editorial/commentary-four-steps-would-help-cms-fix-star-rating-programs-unintended-flaws'>
Commentary: Four steps would help CMS fix star-rating program's unintended flaws
</a></h3><p>Rush University Medical Center in Chicago strives to be a national leader in healthcare quality. We also believe in the vision of the CMS' hospital star-rating program to provide a transparent, consumer-focused measure of quality and safety. We feel, however, that the current construction of the star ratings contains unintended flaws that compromise this measure from its original vision. In collaboration with several other academic centers, we have identified several issues with the program that collectively lead to bias against large hospitals, urban hospitals and hospitals that provide complex care. First, large academic healthcare centers that specialize in providing life-saving care to the sickest patients may be penalized due to statistical issues with the star-rating program.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/safety-quality/medicare-trims-payments-800-hospitals-citing-patient-safety-incidents'>
Medicare trims payments to 800 hospitals, citing patient-safety incidents
</a></h3><p>This year, 800 hospitals will be paid less by Medicare because of high rates of infections and patient injuries, federal records show. The number is the highest since the federal government five years ago launched the Hospital Acquired Conditions (HAC) Reduction Program, created by the Affordable Care Act. Under the program, 1,756 hospitals have been penalized at least once, a Kaiser Health News analysis found. This year, 110 hospitals are being punished for the fifth straight time. The penalties pit hospitals against one another in a race to prevent the most infections, blood clots, cases of sepsis, bedsores, hip fractures and other complications.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/safety/fda-warns-drug-middleman-sending-unsafe-drugs-us'>
FDA warns drug middleman for sending unsafe drugs to U.S.
</a></h3><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter Thursday to CanaRx, a pharmaceutical middleman that is endangering consumers by allegedly selling unapproved, misbranded and unsafe drugs. CanaRx acts as a broker between foreign pharmacies and employer-sponsored health insurance plans. As of 2017, the intermediary contracted with more than 150 public and private employers in about 35 states, the FDA said. CanaRx accepts the employee's U.S. prescription and a foreign doctor rewrites the prescription filled with drugs from an unknown source. The drugs, purportedly sourced from Canada, the United Kingdom or Australia, are then shipped directly to the employee with the standard disclaimer—"Depending on your country, our medications may appear to be different in size, shape or color."</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/government/cms-levies-fewer-fines-medicare-advantage-plans'>
CMS levies fewer fines on Medicare Advantage plans
</a></h3><p>Five Medicare Advantage insurers were hit with fines based on 2018 audits—the lowest number of fines imposed by the CMS in four years. In total, the agency fined the five plans $204,900 for violating Medicare Part C and Part D requirements, it said Thursday. The CMS audited 39 insurers. The fines levied for 2018 audits pale in comparison to those imposed in prior years. In 2018, the CMS fined 18 insurers roughly $2.5 million resulting from audits the previous year.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/insurance/silver-health-plans-set-stiffer-cost-sharing-drugs-employer-plans'>
Silver health plans set stiffer cost-sharing on drugs than employer plans
</a></h3><p>Two new studies show how health plans are jacking up patients' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. The studies highlight some of the concerns raised during Tuesday's Senate Finance Committee hearing featuring the CEOs of seven major pharmaceutical manufacturers. Senators of both parties tore into the executives over their pricing practices, arguing that they have made drugs unaffordable for many Americans. But the CEOs blamed insurers and pharmacy benefit managers for some of the problems. A new analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that enrollees in individual-market health plans in 2019 generally face stiffer cost-sharing requirements for prescription drug coverage than members of small- and large-group employer plans.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/cost-control-ideas-some-controversial-sent-senate-help-chairman'>
Cost control ideas, some controversial, sent to Senate HELP chairman
</a></h3><p>Eight prominent health economists—including moderate liberals and moderate conservatives—have offered a key Senate chairman 13 recommendations for government actions to reduce the growth of healthcare costs. But one of those economists conceded that the chances of federal or state action on most of these proposals is dim due to partisan deadlock in Congress and opposition from stakeholder groups. The economists from the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute sent the suggestions Friday to Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, at his request. Meanwhile, eight health policy experts at Johns Hopkins University sent Alexander a separate report on actions states are considering or taking to directly reduce healthcare price growth.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/people/ascension-taps-duperval-brownlee-new-community-impact-role'>
Ascension taps Duperval-Brownlee for new community impact role
</a></h3><p>Ascension appointed Dr. Tamarah Duperval-Brownlee as its new chief community impact officer, the organization announced Friday. Duperval-Brownlee, who is currently Ascension vice president of care excellence, is tasked with socially integrating healthcare and other entities to "optimize the physical, mental and financial health and well-being of a defined community," according to a news release. She will also oversee the transition of the Providence Health System's 283-bed hospital in Washington, D.C., into a network of telehealth, primary- and urgent-care, home care, community-based behavioral care, and senior care and population health services. "As Ascension continues to lead the transformation of our ministries from their traditional hospital roots into the future of value-based delivery and socially integrated systems of care, I'm excited to have Dr. Duperval-Brownlee take on this work," Patricia Maryland, CEO of Ascension Healthcare, said in prepared remarks.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/house-democrats-seek-legal-justification-title-x-rule'>
House Democrats seek legal justification of Title X rule
</a></h3><p>Several House Democrats on Thursday asked for more information on HHS' new rule that bars abortion clinics from the $290 million Title X family planning network. The Democratic leaders of the House Energy and Commerce committee wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar demanding legal justification for the regulation, set to publish to the Federal Register on Monday. The rule is due to take effect 60 days from the posting unless the courts intervene through one of the lawsuits under review. The lawmakers asked for evidence to justify the requirement that Title X clinics physically separate abortion services from their family planning care. They also asked why HHS believed it can include adoption as a service option for pregnant Title X patients while excluding other options previously covered.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/chs-sells-four-sc-hospitals-176-million'>
CHS sells four S.C. hospitals for $176 million
</a></h3><p>Community Health Systems announced Friday it completed the divestiture of four South Carolina hospitals to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital Authority in Charleston. Subsidiaries of Franklin, Tenn.-based CHS sold 82-bed Chester Regional Medical Center in Chester, 225-bed Springs Memorial Hospital in Lancaster, 396-bed Carolinas Hospital System in Florence and 124-bed Carolinas Hospital System-Marion in Mullins, along with their related physician practices, outpatient services and related businesses, to MUSC Health. As part of the transaction, CHS said in a news release MUSC assumed the long-term lease and operations of Chester Regional Medical Center. The transaction is effective March 1. The four hospitals are among the planned divestitures discussed on CHS' fourth quarter 2018 earnings call.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/likely-return-health-insurance-tax-impact-ma-profits'>
Likely return of the health insurance tax to impact MA profits
</a></h3><p>Congress appears unlikely to delay the health insurance tax next year. If that happens, Medicare Advantage plans would see the biggest impact, analysts and insurers say. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a suspension of the tax, known as the HIT, through 2021. The tax was in place for 2018, suspended in 2019 and is due to take effect again in 2020. But as House lawmakers unrolled their proposal for another delay, senior congressional staff from both chambers and parties said they don't think it's likely to move before insurers start setting their ACA exchange rates next year.</p><br><br><h1 id=Politico><a href='https://www.politico.com/health-care'>Politico</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/pharma-drug-prices-1220080'>Friction between drugmakers, GOP intensifies at hearing on pharma pricing</a></h3><p>The drug industry may no longer be able to take congressional Republicans' support for granted after the Senate Finance Committee grilled seven company executives on their pricing practices on Tuesday. The roughly four-hour Senate Finance Committee hearing didn't yield many fiery confrontations, and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassleyindicated he will go slow pursuing pricing legislation. But the companies took hits from Republican lawmakers like Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who accused AbbVie of abusing the patent system by obtaining 247 patents to protect its multibillion-dollar arthritis drug Humira from competition for more than 30 years. “Is it your company’s position that it should have an exclusive monopoly on that medication for 31 years?” Cornyn asked AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/house-democrats-medicare-for-all-1189139'>House Democrats to release 'Medicare for All' bill — without a price tag</a></h3><p>Progressive House Democrats will unveil their much-hyped “Medicare for All” legislation Wednesday, providing the most detailed blueprint yet for how they would upend the health care system to guarantee coverage for every American — a long-sought progressive dream that is already shaping the Democratic race to challenge President Donald Trump. The bill, co-sponsored by just over 100 House Democrats, doesn’t include a price tag or specific proposals for financing the new system, which analysts estimate would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade. The lead sponsor, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, said she will release a separate list of suggested funding mechanisms, including a tax on high earners or mandated employer contributions. The proposal calls for a two-year transformation of Medicare into a universal single-payer system, eliminating nearly all private health plans.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/22/trump-planned-parenthood-abortion-title-x-1204937'>Trump abortion rule has both sides digging in</a></h3><p>The Trump administration’s overhaul of a federal family planning program is opening a new front in the abortion wars on a divided Capitol Hill. A rule the administration released Friday will effectively cut off tens of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood and other clinics that offer abortions, while steering some of that Title X federal funding toward anti-abortion, faith-based care providers. It’s not the all-out defunding of Planned Parenthood that the Republicans have long sought, but it’s unacceptable to Democrats with new authority over health care and federal spending. "I am committed to fighting the implementation of this rule," said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who leads the House's health care appropriations subcommittee.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/hiv-cancer-donald-trump-1179301'>From moonshot to HIV eradication</a></h3><p>Moonshots have to start on earth. Extensive groundwork went into President Barack Obama’s cancer moonshot, announced during his final State of the Union. And the ambitious project is still blazing ahead, albeit in a different form than it might have under a Democratic administration, with broad bipartisan and science community support. President Donald Trump’s pledge at his own recent State of the Union to stop HIV’s spread by 2030 has the potential to be a crowning public health achievement — but must overcome a lot more skepticism about his record on both health care and LGBTQ rights. Democrats and advocacy groups quickly argued that Trump hadn’t made the necessary overtures to the HIV/AIDS community and in fact had alienated many.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/democrats-obamacare-1170699'>Court allows House Democrats to join Obamacare's defense</a></h3><p>A federal appeals court is allowing House Democrats to defend Obamacare in a lawsuit threatening the future of the health care law. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals today granted the House’s petition to intervene in the case challenging Obamacare's constitutionality. The court will review a federal judge's December ruling that the entire health care law is invalid after Congress eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance. The lawsuit's threat to the Affordable Care Act was a major campaign issue last year and helped Democrats take back the House in November.
