Click To Enlarge. A decade ago, New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH) changed its top leadership with a new CEO and tightened its focus by winnowing to an orthopedics-only specialty hospital. Now, to keep the hospital on track and high performing, NEBH is counting on analysis of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and other critical health care data to guide clinical leadership, says Scott Tromanhauser, MD, MBA, MHCDS, Chief Medical Officer and Chief of Spine Surgery. What if we could predict who would have a bad outcome, based on past PROs, and offer them a nonoperative approach?” “We are just starting to see the fruits of our labor,” Tromanhauser says of one recent analytics effort, started a year ago, to gather long-term patient feedback around total hip replacements, total knee replacements, and spine surgeries to gauge outcomes and patient experience.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/innovation-dialysis-continuous-improvement/'>NEJM Catalyst: Innovation in Dialysis: Continuous Improvement and Implementation</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge. The discovery of new drugs, diagnostics, and devices are typically viewed as innovations in the health care field. Implementation science (i.e., the science of applying research findings and evidence-based interventions to routine clinical practice) is less frequently recognized as a form of innovation. However, it plays a key role in evolving care by translating new techniques, protocols, and clinical insights into the field. While much has been written about the theory of implementation science, very few scientific articles have detailed its best practices in health care.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/bundled-payments-upstream-musculoskeletal-institute/'>NEJM Catalyst: Bundled Payments Are Moving Upstream</a></h3><p>By creating a Musculoskeletal Institute and a bundled payment model that focuses on the condition or person level of care, rather than the procedure level, leaders at Dell Medical School at The University of Texas, Austin are finding early success in improving care outcomes while controlling the cost of care for degenerative musculoskeletal disease. Results include double-digit improvement in functional status of the patients at the first follow-up visit, and a decrease of more than 25% in the utilization of elective surgical procedures among the population receiving care. Development of Bundled Payments Medicare pioneered bundled payments with the adoption of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system for hospital inpatient services in 1983. Since then, bundled payments have expanded and evolved from hospitals to incorporate other providers with the goal of improving patient outcomes and lowering costs, through financial incentives to coordinate care and eliminate inefficient services.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/nursing-bundle-consistent-patient-experience/'>NEJM Catalyst: Using a “Nursing Bundle” to Achieve Consistent Patient Experiences Across a Multi-Hospital System</a></h3><p>Click To Enlarge. Geisinger Health System has evolved and grown in terms of diverse cultures, demography, and size over the past 4 years. We addressed inconsistent patient experience by creating a nursing bundle that helped make patients’ experiences more consistent, and more consistently excellent, improving overall patient satisfaction and Geisinger’s performance on standard assessments of patient satisfaction. Measure what you treasure (data are critical). We are measuring our HCAHPS and nursing bundle scores on a monthly basis.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://catalyst.nejm.org/hypertension-guidelines-achieving-success/'>NEJM Catalyst: Hypertension Guidelines: Achieving 90% Success</a></h3><p>Among clinicians who treat hypertension — which is almost everyone — the 2017 U.S. hypertension guidelines kicked off a frenzy because of the new definition of high blood pressure; but that narrow focus distracts from the global goal. Attention was focused almost exclusively on how a reading of 130/80 had replaced 140/90 as the new standard. But another number should be consuming our attention and arousing our jealousy: 90%. That’s the proportion of patients with hypertension at a few well-organized systems whose blood pressures are controlled, versus 50% to 60% in most of the country. The most pressing question in hypertension is not how we define it in individuals, but how to manage it at the population level.</p><br><br><h1 id=MHealthcare><a href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/'>Modern Healthcare</a></h1><br><h1 id=Politico><a href='https://www.politico.com/health-care'>Politico</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/06/scott-gottlieb-fda-1247687'>Politico: FDA moves on vaping, drugs and food at risk with chief’s departure</a></h3><p>FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb was an outlier in the Trump administration, with an activist agenda touching everything from medical device regulation to youth smoking. His departure puts it all in jeopardy. "Legacies are hard to measure at this point, even if the next commissioner shares Dr. Gottlieb's agenda," said Steven Grossman, a health policy consultant specializing in FDA matters. "Whoever comes next is going to be far more dependent than Dr. Gottlieb on the priorities set by HHS and the White House." Gottlieb's initiatives on nutrition and vaping, along with overhauling regulation of dietary supplements, often were at odds with Republican orthodoxy and the Trump administration's anti-regulatory zeal.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/rand-paul-mandatory-vaccines-measles-1240542'>Politico: Rand Paul condemns mandatory vaccines amid measles outbreak</a></h3><p>Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday railed against government-mandated vaccines, suggesting they infringe on personal rights, during a congressional hearing on immunizations' role in protecting the public from preventable diseases like the current measles outbreak sweeping parts of the country. Paul (R-Ky.), a doctor, said he and his children are vaccinated and that he believes the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks. "But I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security," Paul said during the Senate health committee hearing, where he was the only lawmaker to raise doubts over vaccinations. Paul, who made similar comments during his 2016 presidential bid, argued that vaccines aren't always effective — pointing to the seasonal influenza vaccines that protect only against certain strands — and said it is "wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines," drawing applause from anti-vaccination advocates attending the hearing.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/doctors-gun-control-debate-1231765'>Politico: Politically active doctors test limits of gun control debate</a></h3><p>House Democrats say their increasingly visible alliance with politically active physicians helped them pass legislation mandating federal background checks on all gun sales. But they so far haven’t broken through the wall of opposition in the GOP-majority Senate. Surgeons and other health workers with experience treating firearm wounds lobbied hard for the universal background check bill the House passed last week, adding a sober, public health perspective to a debate long stuck in partisan stalemate. Many had joined the #ThisIsOurLane social media movement after the National Rifle Association in November derided them for engaging in advocacy. “They bring the human factor into it, the human element.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/apple-watch-heart-health-1231602'>Politico: Cardiologists say Apple is overselling its health rollout while FDA applauds </a></h3><p>Apple is touting its new health software with an aggressive public relations strategy that worries many cardiologists, who feel the company is exaggerating the significance of the Apple Watch readings of a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Critics are also concerned that the FDA’s unusual celebration of Apple’s new tech — which is central to the company’s move into health care — represents boosterism that distorts the agency’s role of assuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices. The concerns center on an algorithm accessible through the Apple Watch that detects atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can elevate some individuals’ risk of stroke. In many cases, the watch has given users warnings that led them to get necessary and even life-saving medical help. Stacey Recktenwald, a nurse, said her daughter’s kidney failure “really would’ve been missed” without an Apple Watch warning that her heart rate was elevated.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/03/measles-outbreak-vaccination-1192887'>Politico: State lawmakers pushing for laxer vaccine rules despite measles outbreaks</a></h3><p>Measles is spreading from New York to Texas to Washington state in the worst outbreak in years, but some state lawmakers want to take the vaccination debate in the opposite direction: Loosening rules covering whether kids get inoculated. In Oregon, state lawmakers will consider a so-called transparency bill favored by the "vaccine hesitant." New York is simultaneously considering eliminating and expanding exemptions that allow parents to opt out. One bill in Texas would prohibit the state from even tracking exemptions. The push to loosen the rules is occurring even as the U.S. has experienced more than 160 measles cases in 10 states since Jan. 1, including 74 in Washington state and Oregon linked to the outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, according to the states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><br><br><h1 id=Vox><a href='https://www.vox.com/health-care'>Vox</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/22/18236227/abortion-planned-parenthood-gag-rule-trump'>New Trump administration rule will strip funding from Planned Parenthood</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/4/18249888/medicare-for-all-cost-matt-bruenig-voxcare'>A single-payer advocate answers the big question: How do we pay for it?</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.vox.com/2019/2/28/18244547/jayapal-medicare-for-all-ezra-klein-show'>Pramila Jayapal thinks we can get to Medicare-for-all fast</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.vox.com/2019/2/27/18243090/neomi-rao-dc-circuit-josh-hawley-abortion'>What a Republican fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s replacement says about the abortion debate today</a></h3><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/26/18239630/medicare-for-all-pramila-jayapal-bill'>Rep.
