        <div class='all'><h4>2019-03-02 11:57</h4><h1 id=Fierce><a href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/'>Fierce Biotech</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/rani-therapeutics-completes-first-human-safety-study-its-robotic-biologic-pill'>Rani completes first human study of its robotic biologic pill</a></h3><p>Rani Therapeutics has completed the first human safety study of its oral capsule designed to deliver injectable biologic therapies from within the digestive tract. The company has already raised $142 million to bring it to this point, with its idea poised to potentially reshape markets dominated by blockbuster injectable biologics across a range of indications, which can be difficult or painful to use on a regular basis. Upon entering the small intestine, the RaniPill capsule inflates a small balloon, which then pushes drug-loaded needles into the wall of the organ, for fast uptake into the bloodstream. The capsule uses no metal or springs, or other components that cannot be easily absorbed or passed from the body. In the study, no sensations were reported as the capsule inflated and deployed, and participants were able to successfully pass the remnants of the device within one to four days with no adverse events, the company said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/hemocue-launches-office-hemoglobin-count-system-u-s'>HemoCue launches in-office hemoglobin count system in the U.S.</a></h3><p>Danaher’s point-of-care focused HemoCue subsidiary has launched its newest hemoglobin test in the U.S. following a recent 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The company’s Hb 801 system allows healthcare providers to quickly assess a patient’s hemoglobin levels and detect anemia while they wait, during a single clinic visit. "Our tests make it easy for clinicians to get a lab-quality result while the patient is present, which allows for more engagement in the overall healthcare process,” HemoCue President Christophe Duret said in a statement. The in vitro diagnostic system—consisting of a CLIA-waived analyzer and its own set of small, reagent-free, clear blood containers—measures hemoglobin counts in capillary or venous whole blood, and is intended for use in patients at least one month old.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/fighting-als-dementia-and-more-by-trapping-toxic-brain-proteins'>Fighting ALS, dementia and more by trapping toxic brain proteins</a></h3><p>A pathological form of the protein TDP-43 that’s prone to clumping up in the brain has been implicated in 97% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnoses. It’s also to blame for some cases of Alzheimer’s, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and frontotemporal dementia. But what if TDP-43 could be harnessed in a way that prevents it from forming those toxic clumps? That’s the strategy researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are pursuing. They’ve developed an “oligonucleotide,” a short strand of RNA, that can prevent TDP-43 from building up in neurons.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-warns-public-against-unapproved-robotic-cancer-surgeries-and-mastectomies'>FDA warns public against unapproved robotic cancer surgeries</a></h3><p>The FDA reminded patients and providers that it has not yet approved any robotic system for cancer-related surgeries—specifically mastectomies—and has not established the survival benefits and risks compared to traditional surgical procedures. The agency’s safety communication is in response to reports in the scientific literature and elsewhere, including in the media and promotional materials, that describe surgeons and hospital systems that use robotically assisted surgical devices for mastectomy. In particular, the FDA said it was aware of some peer-reviewed publications reporting poor patient outcomes, including one limited report published in the New England Journal of Medicine last November describing lower long-term disease-free survival in robot-assisted hysterectomies for cervical cancer. The agency also said it has received a small number of medical device injury reports following cancer-related procedures.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gilead-s-kite-pens-10-target-car-t-tech-deal-maxcyte'>Gilead’s Kite pens 10-target CAR-T tech deal with MaxCyte</a></h3><p>Gilead’s Kite Pharma has expanded its CAR-T agreement with MaxCyte. The revised deal gives Kite the chance to apply MaxCyte’s transfection technology to up to 10 targets. Kite first struck a deal to use MaxCyte’s technology, dubbed Flow Electroporation, in November. Now, Kite has significantly expanded the deal by securing the right to use the technology in the nonviral engineering of CAR-T therapies against up to 10 targets. MaxCyte granted Kite nonexclusive access to the technology in return for a financial package featuring development and approval milestones.</p><br><br><h1 id=BioSpace><a href='https://www.biospace.com/news/'>BioSpace</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/uh-oh-2-new-studies-emphasize-on-crispr-off-target-edits/'>Uh-oh! 2 New Studies Emphasize CRISPR Off-Target Edits and Imperfections</a></h3><p> CRISPR, the gene editing technique that promises to revolutionize healthcare and medicine, is not perfect. Right from the beginning, there have been concerns that this technique, which makes it easy to select specific areas of the genome and quickly and easily snip out and replace pieces of DNA, may also make unintended cuts in other areas of the genome at the same time. And two new studies, one in mice embryos and the other in rice plants, seem to confirm this. A 2017 article in Nature brought up the issue, then was later retracted when the authors admitted they had made a mistake. However, there have remained concerns about off-target edits.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/immunogen-plunges-after-phase-iii-ovarian-cancer-treatment-fails-to-hit-pfs-endpoint/'>ImmunoGen Plunges After Phase III Ovarian Cancer Treatment Fails to Hit PFS Endpoint</a></h3><p> Shares of Waltham, Mass.-based ImmunoGen, Inc. have plunged nearly 50 percent in premarket trading after the company’s Phase III ovarian cancer treatment failed to meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. ImmunoGen’s FORWARD I trial was testing the safety and efficacy of mirvetuximab soravtansine compared to chemotherapy in patients with folate receptor alpha (FRα)-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The company said that the late-stage study did not hit its primary endpoint in either the entire study population or in the pre-specified subset of patients with high FRα expression. The 366-patient trial randomized participants 2:1 to receive either mirvetuximab soravtansine or the physician's choice of single-agent chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, or weekly paclitaxel).</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/researchers-identify-new-genes-that-could-play-key-role-in-development-of-alzheimer-s/'>Researchers Identify New Genes That Could Play Key Role in Development of Alzheimer’s</a></h3><p> Research into developing a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease has proven to be incredibly difficult, with multiple companies reporting failure after failure of therapies in the clinic, particularly those focused on amyloid plaques. A new study, though, could help lead to the potential development of a treatment for the dreaded neurological disease. An analysis of the genetics of nearly 95,000 people across the United States and Europe who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease has led to the discovery of four new genetic variants in the body that can increase the risk of developing the form of dementia. According to the study, which was published in Nature Genetics, the risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is partially driven by genetics. Researchers said these four new genes work in tandem with 20 previously-known genome-wide significant common variant signals.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/new-poll-finds-increased-support-for-government-action-on-drug-prices/'>New Poll Finds Increased Support for Government Action on Drug Prices</a></h3><p> With concerns over the costs of prescription drugs taking center stage in American politics during a time when there are shortages of insulin and medical devices like EpiPens, it’s no wonder that the general public is frustrated and is calling on the government to take action of some kind. Results of a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation show that a majority of adults, including seniors, who took the survey, are in favor of government actions that could curb the cost of medication. According to the poll, which was released this morning, the support for government action transcended party identification. Some of the actions supported by the poll-takers include requiring companies to include list prices of drugs in advertisements; creating easier regulatory pathways for drugs to come to market; allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare; allowing prescriptions to be imported from Canada; increasing taxes on drug companies whose prices are deemed too high; and providing Medicare with additional tools and resources when it comes to the medications covered by the program.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/biospace-movers-and-shakers-for-march-1/'>BioSpace Movers and Shakers: March 1</a></h3><p> Agios Pharmaceuticals – Chief Commercial Officer Steven Hoerter has resigned his role at Agios to accept a role as chief executive officer at an oncology-focused biotechnology company. Hoerter’s last day with the company will be March 15, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Notable Labs –California-based Notable expanded its management team with the addition of two seasoned biopharma executives. Hiroomi Tada joined the company as chief medical officer. Tada will oversee Notable’s clinical operations.</p><br></div></body>
