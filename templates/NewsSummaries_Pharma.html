        <div class='all'><h4>2019-03-07 07:34</h4><h1 id=Fierce><a href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/'>Fierce Biotech</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gene-editing-start-up-beam-bags-135m-series-b-top-up'>Fierce Biotech: Gene-editing startup Beam bags $135M in series B top-up</a></h3><p>Beam Therapeutics has raised a healthy $135 million in second-round financing that will be used to advance its single-base approach to gene editing. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, biotech—which was one of our Fierce 15 winners last year—says the new funding will be used to expand its pipeline of development programs, refine its technology platforms and add to its headcount with additional “scientific and technical leadership.” Beam’s take on CRISPR is that that its approach to the technology is more precise than other genome editing techniques and can target just one base—A, G, C or T—out of billions. "Traditional" CRISPR-Cas9 editing cuts a whole gene to make a break in DNA or RNA, while the approach pioneered by one of Beam’s founder’s—David Liu, Ph.D., of Harvard University—directly converts a single base into another. The hope is that it will be able to modify sequences without the risk of unintended, off-target effects that some researchers suggest could be an issue for CRISPR as well as other technologies such as TALEN and zinc finger nucleases.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/extending-use-car-t-cells-lupus'>Fierce Biotech: A CAR-T approach to lupus</a></h3><p>B cells play a key role in lupus, an autoimmune disease that occurs when a patient’s antibodies mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues and organs. Could CAR-T cell therapies, which have shown strong efficacy in B-cell cancers, also be used in lupus? A team of scientists at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center thinks so, and they’ve turned up some positive early evidence to support the approach. The team, led by Marko Radic, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Tennessee, created T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against CD19. The CAR-Ts bind to the B-cell surface marker and kill the targeted cells.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/alnylam-s-givosiran-hits-mark-phase-3-porphyria-test-nda-to-follow-midyear'>Fierce Biotech: Alnylam’s givosiran hits the mark in phase 3 porphyria test</a></h3><p>Alnylam’s givosiran met its primary endpoint in a phase 3 study in the rare liver disease acute hepatic porphyria. In addition to reducing the rate of porphyria attacks over placebo, the ALAS1-targeting RNAi treatment also hit the majority of its secondary endpoints. The company will file a rolling NDA for givosiran in mid-2019. The study enrolled 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), half of whom randomized to receive givosiran, with the other half on placebo, the company said in a statement. Specifically, givosiran outperformed placebo at reducing the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks, that is, those that required hospitalization, an urgent healthcare visit, or an administration of hemin, which is used to treat porphyria attacks.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/gynesonics-debuts-5-year-data-from-its-uterine-fibroid-ablation-treatment'>Fierce Biotech: Gynesonics touts 5-year data from its fibroid ablation device</a></h3><p>2014 Fierce 15 company Gynesonics has unveiled long-term follow-up data, spanning more than five years, that tracks the durability of its incisionless ablation treatment for uterine fibroids. The study showed that no surgical reinterventions were needed in the first 3.4 years following treatment with the company’s Sonata system, with an annualized reintervention rate of 2.2%. Cumulatively—over the study’s average follow-up of 5.4 years in 17 patients—the reintervention rate reached 11.8%. In addition, scores of symptom severity and quality of life improved by an average of 37 points and 49 points, respectively. The full results were published in the Journal of Gynecologic Surgery.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/dbv-loses-regulatory-r-d-execs-ahead-peanut-drug-refile'>Fierce Biotech: DBV loses regulatory, R&D execs ahead of peanut drug refile</a></h3><p>Two of the leaders responsible for regulatory and product development at DBV Technologies are set to leave the company this month. The departures deprive DBV of senior members of its regulatory team as it gears up to refile for FDA approval of its peanut allergy drug. COO Charles Ruban and CDO Laurent Martin are both set to leave their positions at the end of next week, although Martin will remain as DBV’s responsible pharmacist for the purposes of French rules until a replacement is found. DBV said Ruban is leaving to pursue new opportunities but offered no explanation for Martin’s departure. Both men were central to the development of Viaskin Peanut and its submission to FDA.</p><br><br><h1 id=BioSpace><a href='https://www.biospace.com/news/'>BioSpace</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/roche-study-shows-ai-can-detect-severity-of-diabetic-macular-edema/'>BioSpace: Roche Study Shows AI Can Detect Severity of Diabetic Macular Edema</a></h3><p> Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com A new study conducted by researchers from Genentech and Roche shows first-time proof that artificial intelligence can detect the severity of diabetic macular edema, which is a leading cause of blindness. On Monday, researchers from Genentech and its parent company Roche published the study, Deep Learning Predicts OCT Measures of Diabetic Macular Thickening From Color Fundus Photographs” in the journal, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science. The study showed that artificial intelligence can be used to provide widespread, cost-effective eye screenings via telemedicine to assist ophthalmologists in improving vision outcomes for millions of people with diabetes who may not be getting regular eye exams. The article is the first to be published that is part of a Roche/Genentech’s Ophthalmology Personalized Healthcare initiative.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/employer-insights-the-top-3-things-that-define-a-quality-candidate/'>BioSpace: Employer Insights: The Top 3 Things That Define a Quality Candidate</a></h3><p> Do you know what employers in the life sciences industry value when it comes to hiring? Many professionals don’t know, and as a result they just send out their resume and hope for the best. Perhaps, they are fortunate enough to land an interview, however many people feel a little lost and don’t know what to say that will help to distinguish themselves from other candidates. Unfortunately, most people generally receive little (if any) feedback when they don’t get a job offer after interviewing. For this reason, its difficult to know what to improve on when targeting other positions.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/janssen-s-esketamine-treatment-for-depression-approved-by-fda-the-first-in-nearly-50-years/'>BioSpace: Janssen’s Controversial Esketamine Treatment for Depression OK'ed by FDA, the First in Nearly 50 ...</a></h3><p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light to Janssen’s Spravato, an esketamine-based treatment for major depressive disorder. Approval came one month after an FDA advisory panel overwhelmingly supported approval of the nasal spray treatment. The approval marks the first new approach for treating refractory major depressive disorder in nearly 50 years. Spravato is meant to be taken in conjunction with another anti-depression medication, such as Zoloft or another product. Janssen’s esketamine nasal spray is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which is also known as a glutamate receptor modulator.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/scott-gottlieb-resigns-from-role-as-fda-commissioner/'>BioSpace: UPDATE: Scott Gottlieb Resigns From Role as FDA Commissioner</a></h3><p> Albert H Teich / Shutterstock.com Scott Gottlieb, the proactive commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who oversaw a record number of drug approvals has resigned. According to the Washington Post, which was the first to report the news, Gottlieb will leave the regulatory agency in about a month. Gottlieb intends to spend more time with his family, the Post said. At 46, he is the father of three children, nine-year-old twins and a five-year-old. He commutes weekly from Connecticut, the Post said.In his letter of resignation, which was shared on Twitter late Tuesday, Gottlieb said he loved the mission of the FDA, but said the challenge of being away from his wife and children was too much.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/alnylam-stock-drops-7-5-percent-despite-positive-data-on-phase-iii-givosiran-trial/'>BioSpace: Alnylam's Givosiran Looks Positive Overall in Phase III Trial for Rare Disease</a></h3><p> Despite releasing positive data on its Phase III ENVISION trial, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals stock dropped 7.5 percent. Although not completely clear why, the drop may be related to a high percentage of serious adverse events observed in the trial. The ENVISION Phase III trial evaluated givosiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that targets aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). AHP is a family of rare, genetic diseases characterized by possibly life-threatening attacks and for some, chronic debilitating symptoms. AHP is made up of four subtypes, each caused by a genetic defect that leads to a deficiency in one of the enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver.</p><br></div></body>
