The treatment beat out placebo in completely clearing treatable lesions and reducing the number of lesions in both studies. The West Chester, Pennsylvania-based company plans to file an NDA for the asset, dubbed VP-102, in the second half of 2019. VP-102 is being developed for common warts, plantar and external genital warts, as well as molluscum, a contagious viral skin infection most commonly seen in children. The skin lesions tend to clear on their own, but this can take a year or longer, and during that time, skin-to-skin contact can spread the virus to other people or to parts of a person’s body that aren’t infected.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/rani-therapeutics-completes-first-human-safety-study-its-robotic-biologic-pill'>Fierce Biotech: Rani completes first human study of its robotic biologic pill</a></h3><p>Rani Therapeutics has completed the first human safety study of its oral capsule designed to deliver injectable biologic therapies from within the digestive tract. The company has already raised $142 million to bring it to this point, with its idea poised to potentially reshape markets dominated by blockbuster injectable biologics across a range of indications, which can be difficult or painful to use on a regular basis. Upon entering the small intestine, the RaniPill capsule inflates a small balloon, which then pushes drug-loaded needles into the wall of the organ, for fast uptake into the bloodstream. The capsule uses no metal or springs, or other components that cannot be easily absorbed or passed from the body. In the study, no sensations were reported as the capsule inflated and deployed, and participants were able to successfully pass the remnants of the device within one to four days with no adverse events, the company said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/hemocue-launches-office-hemoglobin-count-system-u-s'>Fierce Biotech: HemoCue launches in-office hemoglobin count system in the U.S.</a></h3><p>Danaher’s point-of-care focused HemoCue subsidiary has launched its newest hemoglobin test in the U.S. following a recent 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The company’s Hb 801 system allows healthcare providers to quickly assess a patient’s hemoglobin levels and detect anemia while they wait, during a single clinic visit. "Our tests make it easy for clinicians to get a lab-quality result while the patient is present, which allows for more engagement in the overall healthcare process,” HemoCue President Christophe Duret said in a statement. The in vitro diagnostic system—consisting of a CLIA-waived analyzer and its own set of small, reagent-free, clear blood containers—measures hemoglobin counts in capillary or venous whole blood, and is intended for use in patients at least one month old.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/fighting-als-dementia-and-more-by-trapping-toxic-brain-proteins'>Fierce Biotech: Fighting ALS, dementia and more by trapping toxic brain proteins</a></h3><p>A pathological form of the protein TDP-43 that’s prone to clumping up in the brain has been implicated in 97% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnoses. It’s also to blame for some cases of Alzheimer’s, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and frontotemporal dementia. But what if TDP-43 could be harnessed in a way that prevents it from forming those toxic clumps? That’s the strategy researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are pursuing. They’ve developed an “oligonucleotide,” a short strand of RNA, that can prevent TDP-43 from building up in neurons.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-warns-public-against-unapproved-robotic-cancer-surgeries-and-mastectomies'>Fierce Biotech: FDA warns public against unapproved robotic cancer surgeries</a></h3><p>The FDA reminded patients and providers that it has not yet approved any robotic system for cancer-related surgeries—specifically mastectomies—and has not established the survival benefits and risks compared to traditional surgical procedures. The agency’s safety communication is in response to reports in the scientific literature and elsewhere, including in the media and promotional materials, that describe surgeons and hospital systems that use robotically assisted surgical devices for mastectomy. In particular, the FDA said it was aware of some peer-reviewed publications reporting poor patient outcomes, including one limited report published in the New England Journal of Medicine last November describing lower long-term disease-free survival in robot-assisted hysterectomies for cervical cancer. The agency also said it has received a small number of medical device injury reports following cancer-related procedures.</p><br><br><h1 id=BioSpace><a href='https://www.biospace.com/news/'>BioSpace</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/sponsored-five-unique-problems-that-mes-can-address-for-cell-and-gene-therapy-manufacturing-/'>BioSpace: Sponsored | Five Unique Problems That MES Can Address for Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing </a></h3><p> 1. Speeding up treatment for patients - Getting the treatment to the patient as quickly as possible. Solution: MES enables manufacturing automation by reducing manufacturing time and risk.
