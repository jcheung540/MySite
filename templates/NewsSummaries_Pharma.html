The study examined 282 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer over nearly two years, with each taking the Guardant360 liquid biopsy aimed at circulating cell-free DNA, as well as the physician’s choice of tissue-based test. When it came to identifying patients with at least one of seven guideline-recommended predictive genomic biomarkers—EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET and ERBB2, which can also aid in treatment selection—Guardant360 detected alterations in 77 patients, while tissue-based testing found 60; a similar rate, if a little higher. In addition, for the four mutations targeted by an FDA-approved therapy, namely EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF, the blood test was able to detect the same alteration in the same patients as traditional biopsy, Guardant said.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/new-insight-into-how-tecfidera-works-may-lead-to-better-ms-therapies'>New insight into Tecfidera may lead to better MS therapies</a></h3><p>Biogen’s top-selling Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) has proven to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis, bringing in $4.27 billion in sales in 2018, but its exact mechanism of action remains a mystery. Now scientists from the City University of New York and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have identified a possible mechanism of action, providing information that they believe could lead to better drugs for MS and other autoimmune diseases. MS happens when brain-homing T cells mistakenly attack the central nervous system. In their paper, which is featured on the March cover of the journal Brain, the CUNY-Mount Sinai team suggested that Tecfidera—after it is metabolized by the body—works via a particular DNA region to reduce the development of these harmful immune cells. During the study, the researchers analyzed 35 patients who were given Tecfidera and 16 who were treated with Teva’s Copaxone.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/horizon-pharma-s-inflammatory-eye-drug-aces-phase-3-poised-for-midyear-bla'>Horizon Pharma's inflammatory eye drug aces phase 3</a></h3><p>Horizon Pharma’s inflammatory eye drug teprotumumab met its primary endpoint in a phase 3 study, with topline data showing the drug beat out placebo in reducing proptosis, or bulging of the eye. The candidate also met its secondary endpoints, and Horizon plans to submit a BLA in mid-2019. Teprotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor. Dublin-based Horizon picked it up in its $145 million acquisition of River Vision in May 2017. The deal came after The New England Journal of Medicine published phase 2 data looking at teprotumumab in patients with recent-onset, moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease (TED), a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-plummets-after-another-phase-3-rsv-study-failure-time-infants'>Novavax plummets after another phase 3 RSV study miss</a></h3><p>Once described as having the potential to become “the largest selling vaccine in the history of vaccines,” Novavax’s fusion protein nanoparticle shot against respiratory syncytial virus has missed another phase 3 trial, causing the company’s stock price to lose about two-thirds of its remaining value in premarket trading. In September 2016, Novavax’s shares plunged after a placebo-controlled study of nearly 12,000 adults, age 60 and over, failed to meet its efficacy objectives in preventing RSV-related disease in the lower respiratory tract. The company cut 30% of its workforce two months later. Now, after moving forward with an $89.1 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the recombinant RSV vaccine ResVax flunked its primary endpoint in the maternal immunization of infants.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/bispecifics-player-abpro-teams-up-china-s-njcttq-biobucks-deal-worth-up-to-4b'>Abpro teams up with China’s NJCTTQ in biobucks deal worth up to $4B</a></h3><p>Abpro is partnering with China-based NJCTTQ to develop new bispecific antibodies using its antibody discovery platform. Under the agreement, Abpro could collect up to $4 billion, which includes $60 million in “near-term R&D funding,” as well as milestone payments and royalties. Abpro will hold on to the rights for any drugs approved outside of China and Thailand, and NJCTTQ will retain the rights in China, Abpro said in a statement. The pair will use Abpro’s DiversImmune technology, one of two platforms the Massachusetts-based company uses to develop drug candidates. The company was vague about the targets of the collaboration, saying only that they would develop bispecific antibodies, such as T-cell engagers, for immuno-oncology.</p><br><br><h1 id=BioSpace><a href='https://www.biospace.com/news/'>BioSpace</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/biospace-movers-and-shakers-for-march-1/'>BioSpace Movers and Shakers: March 1</a></h3><p> Agios Pharmaceuticals – Chief Commercial Officer Steven Hoerter has resigned his role at Agios to accept a role as chief executive officer at an oncology-focused biotechnology company.
