The takeover will give Biogen control of clinical-phase ophthalmology assets that could get to market ahead of drugs in development at rival gene therapy shops. Since spinning out of Oxford University in 2013, Nightstar has advanced two gene therapies targeting retinal indications through the clinic using VC and IPO monies. A phase 3 trial of the lead candidate, NSR-REP1, is set to finish enrolling choroideremia patients in the coming months, teeing Nightstar up to find out if it it can tackle the currently-untreatable form of progressive vision loss. Nightstar also has an X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) gene therapy in earlier-phase development.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/stroke-prevention-devicemaker-silk-road-medical-files-86m-ipo'>Fierce Biotech: Stroke-prevention medtech Silk Road Medical files $86M IPO</a></h3><p>Silk Road Medical, manufacturers of a stent and neuroprotection system designed to restore blood flow in the carotid arteries and prevent strokes, announced plans for an $86.25 million IPO on the Nasdaq, under the ticker symbol SILK. The Sunnyvale, California-based company plans to use the proceeds to expand its sales force and commercial operations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as increase its R&D activities and conduct new clinical studies, according to its prospectus filed with the SEC. The financial terms of the offering were not disclosed. Silk Road first began selling its products in the U.S. in 2015. Designed for transcarotid artery revascularization, or TCAR procedures, the minimally invasive system redirects carotid blood flow away from the brain to protect it from stray pieces of plaque that may break loose during the placement of a stent or balloon angioplasty.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/former-olympus-president-named-ceo-hands-free-surgical-robot-startup'>Fierce Biotech: Olympus president named CEO of hands-free surgical robot startup</a></h3><p>The former president of Olympus' Medical Systems Group, Todd Usen, has taken the helm of a Boston-based startup developing a surgical robot that can autonomously suture soft tissue. Usen will serve as the first CEO of Activ Surgical, which aims to integrate computer vision technology, artificial intelligence and robotics into its Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) system. Founded in 2017, Activ is based around the technology developed by Kim and his colleagues at the Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. The company hopes to develop it into a software-centric, hardware-agnostic platform. A previous study published in Science Translational Medicine compared the performance of Activ’s early system to manual surgery, laparoscopy and robot-assisted techniques in stitching together separate portions of intestine in living pigs.</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/zafgen-nabs-ex-biogen-executive-priya-singhal-as-new-r-d-chief'>Fierce Biotech: Zafgen nabs ex-Biogen executive Priya Singhal as new R&D chief</a></h3><p>Former Biogen executive Priya Singhal, M.D., M.P.H., has joined Zafgen as its new head of research and development. She comes to the role after helping shepherd several programs toward regulatory filings and approvals, including multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and spinal muscular atrophy treatment Spinraza. At Biogen, Singhal served as a senior vice president, global head of safety and benefit risk management and interim global co-lead and SVP of global development. In addition to leading the benefit-risk strategy for Biogen’s portfolio, she also worked on the company’s overall R&D strategy and drug development plans, chaired safety governance and led interactions on several products with regulators worldwide.

Two discoveries announced on Monday—one related to a new combination treatment and the other to genetic testing—could improve the prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer. The potential new treatment strategy capitalizes on a natural process known as autophagy, in which cells recycle some of their own components to use as an energy source. Researchers at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center figured out how to coax pancreatic cancer cells to become more reliant on autophagy, while at the same time blocking the energy pathway the cells need to survive. The treatment combines hydroxychloroquine—a drug normally used to treat malaria and some autoimmune diseases—with a second compound that indirectly targets KRAS, a gene that’s frequently mutated in pancreatic cancer.</p><br><br><h1 id=BioSpace><a href='https://www.biospace.com/news/'>BioSpace</a></h1><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/sponsored-five-unique-problems-that-mes-can-address-for-cell-and-gene-therapy-manufacturing-/'>BioSpace: Sponsored | Five Unique Problems That MES Can Address for Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing </a></h3><p> 1. Speeding up treatment for patients - Getting the treatment to the patient as quickly as possible. Solution: MES enables manufacturing automation by reducing manufacturing time and risk.

Selective TGF-beta inhibition by AVID200 could rapidly reverse fibrosis, and I am keen to investigate the potential of AVID200 to transform the treatment of SSc,” commented Coordinating Principal Investigator Robert Lafyatis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Medsger Professor and Director of the Scleroderma Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. TGF-beta signaling is central to SSc pathogenesis (Lafyatis, 2014), and TGF-beta isoforms 1 & 3, but not 2, correlate positively with disease severity (O’Connor et al., 2018).</p><br><h3><a class='link' href='https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/campaign-invites-women-to-and-quot-unlearn-and-quot-what-they-know-about-menopause/'>BioSpace: Campaign invites women to "unlearn" what they know about menopause</a></h3><p>VANCOUVER, March 4, 2019 /CNW/ - International Women's Day, coming up on Friday, March 8th, is all about challenging stereotypes.
